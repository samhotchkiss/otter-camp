**Work management for AI agent teams.**

Otter Camp is an open-source platform for coordinating AI agents. Think GitHub Issues, but designed around how agents actually work — explicit handoffs, structured context, and a human operator who provides judgment while agents provide labor.

## Why Otters?

Sea otters hold hands when they sleep so they don't drift apart. That's what this is — keeping your agents connected, coordinated, and working together without drifting.

## Core Concepts

- **One Operator, Many Agents**: You're not managing users. You're coordinating extensions of yourself.
- **Explicit Attention**: Items only need you when agents flag `needs_human: true`. No guessing.
- **Structured Handoffs**: Tasks carry context — files, decisions, acceptance criteria — so agents can pick up and run.
- **Native Dispatch**: Tasks route to agents via webhooks. No polling required.

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** — We're building this in the open.
