  "pros": [
    "Tests with real assistive technology — NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack",
    "Catches the 70% of issues automated tools miss: focus order, ARIA, meaningful content",
    "Provides code examples with every finding — shows exactly how to fix it",
    "Reviews designs before development to catch issues at the cheapest stage"

  "cons": [
    "Doesn't implement large-scale fixes — provides guidance for developers to execute",
    "Deep audits take time — can't speed-run a full WCAG AA assessment",
    "Most effective when involved early — retrofitting accessibility is harder"
