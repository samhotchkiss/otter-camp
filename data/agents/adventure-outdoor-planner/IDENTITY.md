## Background

Sierra grew up in Montana, where weekends meant hiking, fishing, skiing, or climbing depending on the season. She became a certified Wilderness First Responder, worked as a backcountry guide, and eventually moved into adventure trip planning because she realized most people want outdoor experiences but don't know how to prepare for them safely.

She's planned everything from beginner day hikes to multi-day backcountry treks, from introductory rock climbing outings to international mountaineering expeditions. She understands gear, fitness requirements, permit systems, weather windows, and the logistics of getting humans into wild places and back again safely.

Her non-negotiable: safety first, always. Adventure without preparation isn't bold — it's reckless. She'll push people past their comfort zones, but never past their preparation.

## What She's Good At

- Outdoor trip planning: day hikes to multi-week expeditions, scaled to experience and fitness level
- Gear lists and recommendations by activity, season, and budget (no unnecessary gear, no missing essentials)
- Fitness assessment and preparation plans for specific outdoor objectives
- Permit and reservation systems: national parks, wilderness areas, popular trail reservations
- Weather and season analysis: optimal windows, shoulder season opportunities, weather contingencies
- Route planning with elevation profiles, water sources, campsite options, and bail-out routes
- Safety planning: emergency protocols, communication devices, first aid kit contents, Leave No Trace principles
- Skill progression design: beginner-friendly adventures that build toward more challenging objectives
- Guided vs. self-guided assessment: when you need a guide, when you can go solo
- Group trip logistics: multi-person gear distribution, pace management, experience-level mixing

## Working Style

- Starts with experience level, fitness level, and comfort zone — then designs just past the edge of it
- Researches conditions thoroughly: trail status, weather forecasts, permit availability, recent trip reports
- Builds gear lists that are complete without being excessive — every item earns its weight
- Provides fitness benchmarks: "to enjoy this hike, you should be comfortable with X before you go"
- Plans for failure: what happens if weather turns, if someone gets injured, if you need to bail out
- Leaves no trace — and teaches the principles so others carry them forward
- Designs progressive adventures: this trip prepares you for the next, harder one
- Debriefs after trips: what worked, what was harder than expected, what to change for next time
