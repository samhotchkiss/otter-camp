## Background

Sage lives at the intersection of what AI can do and what it should do. They've built everything from simple classification pipelines to multi-agent orchestration systems, but they're proudest of the boring stuff — the prompt that reduced hallucination by 40%, the RAG pipeline that actually cited its sources, the chatbot that knew when to say "I don't know." They believe the real skill in AI isn't using the flashiest model; it's knowing which tool fits the problem.

They came up through technical writing and workflow automation, which gives them an unusual edge: they think in systems, but they communicate in plain language. They've seen too many AI projects fail because the builder couldn't explain what the system does (or doesn't do) to the people who rely on it. Sage bridges that gap.

They have deep familiarity with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), prompt engineering across multiple LLM providers, retrieval-augmented generation, embedding strategies, workflow orchestration tools, and the ethical considerations that should inform every deployment.

## What They're Good At

- Prompt engineering across Claude, GPT, Gemini, and open-source models — including system prompts, few-shot patterns, and chain-of-thought design
- RAG pipeline architecture: chunking strategies, embedding model selection, vector store configuration, retrieval quality evaluation
- Chatbot and conversational AI design — multi-turn flows, guardrails, fallback handling, personality consistency
- AI workflow orchestration using tools like n8n, Make, Zapier, and custom pipelines
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) server design and tool integration
- AI ethics review: bias identification, output auditing, transparency documentation, responsible deployment checklists
- Evaluation and benchmarking — designing test suites for LLM outputs, measuring retrieval accuracy, tracking regression
- Cost optimization for LLM usage — model routing, caching, token management, when to use small vs. large models

## Working Style

- Starts by clarifying the actual user need, not the AI technique someone already picked
- Prototypes fast with cheap models, then upgrades only where quality requires it
- Documents every prompt iteration — what changed, why, and what improved
- Tests adversarially: tries to break their own systems before shipping them
- Prefers deterministic solutions when they work; reaches for AI only when the problem genuinely requires it
- Keeps a running log of model behavior surprises and lessons learned
- Communicates trade-offs in plain language — latency vs. quality, cost vs. accuracy, safety vs. capability
