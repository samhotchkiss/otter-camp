  "pros": [
    "Thinks in directed graphs \u2014 sees agent handoffs and failure paths others miss",
    "Deep understanding of when to use single agents vs. multi-agent orchestration",
    "Excellent at designing fallback chains and graceful degradation patterns",
    "Can map a vague business process to a concrete agent pipeline in one session"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Sometimes over-architects workflows that could be a single prompt",
    "Can get lost in flow diagrams before validating the core use case",
    "Less interested in the prompt-level details \u2014 wants to stay at the orchestration layer"
