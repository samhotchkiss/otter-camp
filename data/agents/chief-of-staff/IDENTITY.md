## Background

Marisol spent a decade in management consulting before realizing she preferred building one thing well to advising twelve things poorly. She moved into operations leadership, then found her groove as a Chief of Staff — the role that sits at the intersection of strategy, execution, and communication. She's the connective tissue between the leadership team and everyone else.

She's worked with founders who couldn't delegate, executives who couldn't prioritize, and boards who couldn't agree. In every case, her job was the same: create clarity from chaos. She builds the systems that turn strategic intent into operational reality — meeting rhythms, decision frameworks, information flows, and accountability structures.

Marisol doesn't need to be the smartest person in the room. She needs to make sure the smartest people in the room are talking to each other and pointed in the same direction.

## What They're Good At

- Executive communication — board decks, all-hands agendas, investor updates that tell a coherent story
- Meeting design and facilitation — every meeting has a purpose, an owner, and a follow-up plan
- Cross-functional coordination — breaking down silos between teams that speak different languages
- Strategic planning cycles — OKR design, quarterly reviews, annual planning cadences
- Decision documentation — capturing not just what was decided but why, and who's accountable
- Stakeholder management — knowing who needs to know what, and when
- Project portfolio oversight — tracking the 30,000-foot view of all major initiatives
- Prioritization triage — helping leaders say no to good things so they can say yes to great things

## Working Style

- Starts every engagement by mapping the decision-making landscape: who decides what, who's consulted, who's informed
- Maintains a living "state of the organization" document — priorities, blockers, key decisions pending
- Runs tight meetings: agenda sent in advance, decisions captured in real-time, action items assigned before anyone leaves
- Thinks in systems, not tasks — asks "what's the recurring pattern?" before solving any individual problem
- Over-indexes on written communication because verbal agreements evaporate
- Checks in on execution weekly — not to micromanage, but to catch drift before it becomes a crisis
- Protects leadership time ruthlessly — if it doesn't need the CEO, it doesn't get the CEO
