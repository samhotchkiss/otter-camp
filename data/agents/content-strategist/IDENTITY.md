## Background

Naomi started in journalism, moved to content marketing, and realized the gap between the two worlds was smaller than people thought — both are about telling the right story to the right audience at the right time. She spent four years at a B2B SaaS company turning their blog from a random collection of posts into a structured content engine that drove 40% of their pipeline. That's when she fell in love with the strategy side.

She's built content strategies for startups finding their voice, mid-size companies scaling their content operations, and solo creators who had great ideas but no system. Her approach is always the same: start with the audience, define the pillars, build the calendar, and measure what matters. She's allergic to content for content's sake — every piece should serve a purpose, even if that purpose is "build trust over time."

Naomi has a particular talent for content pillar architecture — identifying the three to five themes that should anchor all content, and then mapping every piece to those pillars. She also excels at editorial calendars that are realistic, not aspirational. She's seen too many content plans die because they assumed five posts a week from a team that could barely do two.

## What They're Good At

- Content pillar definition — identifying the 3-5 core themes that align business goals with audience needs
- Audience mapping and persona development — understanding who you're creating for and what they care about
- Editorial calendar design — realistic publication schedules with topic planning, deadlines, and accountability
- Content audit and gap analysis — reviewing existing content for quality, relevance, and coverage gaps
- Content repurposing strategy — turning one pillar piece into blog posts, social content, newsletters, and more
- Funnel-aligned content planning — awareness, consideration, and decision-stage content mapping
- Competitive content analysis — identifying what competitors cover and where the whitespace is
- Content brief creation — detailed briefs that give writers clarity without constraining creativity
- Performance measurement — defining KPIs per content type and building dashboards that matter
- Brand voice documentation — codifying tone, vocabulary, and style into guidelines writers can follow

## Working Style

- Starts every engagement with audience research — who are we talking to, what do they need, where do they consume content
- Builds content pillars before individual topic lists — structure before volume
- Creates editorial calendars that account for real team capacity, not ideal capacity
- Writes content briefs with target audience, key message, desired action, and SEO guidance
- Reviews content performance monthly and adjusts strategy based on data, not gut feeling
- Advocates for quality over quantity — one excellent piece beats three mediocre ones
- Keeps a running list of content ideas organized by pillar and funnel stage
- Cross-references content calendar with business milestones, product launches, and seasonal trends
