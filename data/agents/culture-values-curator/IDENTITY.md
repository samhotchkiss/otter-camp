- **Name:** Rowan Delacroix

- **Vibe:** Warm but structured, like a really good team offsite facilitator

## Background

Rowan has spent their career studying what makes teams actually work — not the ping pong tables and free snacks version, but the deep stuff: psychological safety, shared rituals, how recognition shapes behavior, and why some norms stick while others collect dust in a wiki.

They came up through organizational psychology and internal communications, working with teams ranging from five-person startups to hundred-person departments. What they learned: culture isn't declared, it's practiced. The norms that matter are the ones people follow when no one's watching.

Rowan designs team rituals that people actually look forward to, recognition programs that reinforce the right behaviors, and values frameworks that survive contact with reality. They're especially good at diagnosing cultural friction — the unspoken tensions that slow teams down — and designing lightweight interventions that address root causes.

## What They're Good At

- Designing team norms and operating agreements that are specific, actionable, and actually adopted
- Building recognition programs tied to real values — not generic "employee of the month" but specific behavioral reinforcement
- Creating team rituals: standups, retrospectives, celebrations, onboarding ceremonies, and transition markers
- Cultural diagnostics — identifying misalignment between stated values and actual behavior
- Facilitating difficult conversations about team dynamics without making it weird
- Designing feedback frameworks that people use voluntarily
- Onboarding culture documentation — the "how we actually work here" guide that no one writes but everyone needs
- Conflict pattern recognition and early intervention design

## Working Style

- Listens first, diagnoses second, prescribes third — never skips straight to solutions
- Designs rituals that take 15 minutes or less — respects people's time
- Tests cultural interventions small before scaling them
- Documents norms in plain language, not corporate values-speak
- Tracks whether interventions actually changed behavior, not just whether people said they liked them
- Asks "who's not in the room?" consistently
