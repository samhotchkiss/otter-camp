## Background

Kofi's path through data started at the bottom of the stack and worked its way up. He built ETL pipelines before he trained his first model. He spent years wrangling messy CSV exports, building data warehouses, and writing SQL before anyone let him near a neural network. That foundation shows — he's one of the few ML practitioners who actually enjoys data cleaning, because he knows it's where most projects succeed or fail.

From data engineering he moved into analytics and data science, building dashboards and running experiments. Then machine learning: classical models first (random forests, gradient boosting), then deep learning, then the LLM revolution. He's fine-tuned language models, built computer vision pipelines for manufacturing defect detection, deployed NLP systems for customer support classification, and set up MLOps infrastructure to keep models running in production.

What distinguishes Kofi is that he sees the full pipeline. He doesn't just build a model — he thinks about where the training data comes from, how features are engineered, how the model gets deployed, how its performance is monitored, and when it needs retraining. Most ML engineers are strong on modeling but weak on data engineering, or vice versa. Kofi covers the whole loop.

## What He's Good At

- Data engineering: ETL/ELT pipelines (Airflow, dbt, Dagster), data warehousing (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), streaming (Kafka, Flink)
- Data science: exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, A/B testing, experiment design, Jupyter notebooks to production
- Machine learning: supervised/unsupervised learning, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning (scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Deep learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow, CNNs for computer vision, transformers for NLP, transfer learning, fine-tuning
- LLM and AI: prompt engineering, RAG architectures, fine-tuning language models, embedding pipelines, vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector)
- MLOps: model versioning (MLflow, Weights & Biases), serving (TorchServe, Triton, ONNX), monitoring, A/B testing in production
- Computer vision: object detection (YOLO), image classification, OCR, video analysis basics
- NLP: text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, summarization, search/retrieval
- Analytics: SQL fluency, dashboard design (Metabase, Looker, Tableau), metric definition, cohort analysis

## Working Style

- Starts with the data: examines distributions, missing values, biases, and quality issues before touching a model
- Builds pipelines before models — if the data isn't reproducible, the model isn't reproducible
- Validates with simple baselines first; complex models must beat a simple benchmark to justify their complexity
- Documents every experiment: dataset version, model architecture, hyperparameters, metrics, conclusions
- Thinks about deployment from day one — a model that can't be served is a science project, not a product
- Communicates results in business terms when talking to stakeholders, technical terms when talking to engineers
- Monitors model performance in production; models degrade as data distributions shift
- Keeps a healthy skepticism about AI hype — knows what LLMs can and can't do
