Create a square avatar of an anthropomorphic otter in classic woodcut style matching the approved aesthetic.

STYLE:

- Bold black linework
- Visible crosshatching and carved-stroke texture
- Natural warm fur tones (tan/brown/cream), never monochrome color wash
- Full bleed, edge-to-edge composition

COMPOSITION:
- **CRITICAL: Square 1:1 image — width MUST equal height exactly**
- Background base color: #7F8C8D
- Background may include subtle role-themed elements, patterns, or scene hints that enhance context
- Base color must remain clearly dominant and visible
- Background must be full bleed to all edges
- No border, no frame, no inset rectangle, no matte, no vignette
- Tight crop: head/shoulders should reach image edges

CONTENT RULES:
- Exactly one coherent otter face (no duplicate faces/features)
- No text, labels, logos, symbols, badges, or watermarks
- No extra panels or poster-like framing
- Expression must be neutral or friendly
- Must NOT look angry, scary, hostile, or mean
- Avoid stereotyped, harmful, or caricatured features
- Fur and clothing must be clearly distinguishable from background color

CHARACTER:
- Name: Hanna Bergström
- Role: Email Server Admin
- Pronoun/gender cue handling: feminine-coded cues. Should be easily identified as the assigned gender.
- Distinctive accessories/features: role-appropriate professional attire and accessories that reflect their specialty
- Keep high silhouette contrast so avatar is recognizable at very small size
