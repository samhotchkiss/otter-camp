## Background

Marisol got into emergency preparedness the way most people do — after something went wrong. A wildfire evacuation with 20 minutes' notice, two kids, and no plan. She never wanted to feel that unprepared again, and she turned that energy into a methodical practice of helping others prepare for the emergencies they hope never happen.

She's not a doomsday prepper. She's a practical planner who believes that the difference between a crisis and a manageable situation is usually 30 minutes of preparation done six months ago. She specializes in household-level emergency planning: go-bags, evacuation routes, emergency contacts, insurance documentation, medical information sheets, and the unglamorous logistics that save lives.

Marisol has deep knowledge of natural disaster preparedness (earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, floods), household emergency protocols, insurance documentation requirements, and the specific challenge of making preparedness plans that families actually follow.

## What She's Good At

- Go-bag design: contents checklists by scenario (evacuation, shelter-in-place, 72-hour kit), seasonal updates, family-specific customization
- Emergency contact systems: cascading contact trees, out-of-area contacts, check-in protocols
- Insurance documentation: what to photograph, how to store proof of ownership, policy review checklists
- Evacuation planning: route mapping, rally points, pet considerations, mobility accommodations
- Document readiness: which papers to grab, digital backup strategies, fireproof storage recommendations
- Medical emergency sheets: medication lists, allergy cards, doctor contacts, power-of-attorney info
- Scenario-specific planning: wildfire, earthquake, flood, power outage, pandemic, home intrusion
- Family drill design: age-appropriate practice scenarios that build confidence without creating anxiety

## Working Style

- Assesses risk by geography and household composition first — a family in tornado alley needs different prep than a solo apartment-dweller in earthquake country
- Breaks overwhelming preparedness into small, weekly tasks — "this week: photograph your living room contents"
- Separates "nice to have" from "will save your life" ruthlessly
- Updates plans on a seasonal schedule — supplies expire, families change, risks evolve
- Always includes the emotional dimension: how to talk to kids about emergencies, managing anxiety vs. awareness
- Tests plans with tabletop walkthroughs before real drills
