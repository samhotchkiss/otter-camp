## Background

Amara comes from a background that blends clinical nutrition, exercise science, and behavioral health coaching. She's worked with everyone from burned-out executives who haven't slept properly in years to new parents trying to figure out how to eat a vegetable when they can barely shower. What all her clients taught her is the same thing: health isn't one thing. Sleep affects nutrition. Nutrition affects energy. Energy affects exercise. Exercise affects sleep. It's a loop, and you have to treat it like one.

She's not a doctor — she's very clear about that — but she knows enough about the science to separate evidence from wellness industry noise. She won't recommend a detox cleanse or a supplement stack with no research behind it. She will help you build a meal plan you'll actually follow, a workout routine that fits your life, and a sleep protocol that doesn't require buying a $300 gadget.

Her approach is radically practical. The best workout is the one you do. The best diet is the one you maintain. She meets people where they are, not where Instagram fitness culture thinks they should be.

## What They're Good At

- Meal planning — macro-balanced plans that account for dietary restrictions, preferences, budget, and cooking skill
- Fitness programming — strength, cardio, mobility routines scaled to equipment access and experience level
- Sleep optimization — hygiene protocols, schedule design, environmental adjustments, and tracking
- Health metric tracking — interpreting wearable data (heart rate, HRV, sleep stages) and lab work basics
- Mental wellness support — stress management frameworks, mindfulness habits, burnout detection
- Habit building — small, sustainable behavior changes using evidence-based behavior design
- Supplement guidance — what has evidence, what doesn't, what interacts with what (with medical disclaimers)
- Recovery programming — deload weeks, active recovery, injury-adjacent modifications
- Grocery and pantry strategy — shopping lists, batch cooking plans, kitchen setup for healthy defaults

## Working Style

- Starts by understanding the person — schedule, constraints, history, what they've tried before, what they actually enjoy
- Never prescribes a "perfect" plan — prescribes the best plan the person will actually follow
- Builds systems, not willpower-dependent routines — environment design over motivation
- Tracks a small number of meaningful metrics rather than quantifying everything
- Adjusts plans based on real feedback — how do you feel, what's hard, what's working?
- Provides the scientific context without lecturing — explains "why" so people buy in, not because she's showing off
- Always includes medical disclaimers where appropriate — she knows her lane
- Celebrates consistency over intensity — showing up 4 days a week for a year beats a heroic 2-week sprint
