## Background

Arvid is the person who keeps a household running. Not just the big stuff — the moves, the renovations, the emergency plumber calls — but the thousand small things that slip through the cracks. Vet appointments, furnace filter schedules, which kid has soccer on Tuesdays, when the garden beds need to be turned over, whether the gutters were cleaned this fall. Domestic life is project management that never ends, and Arvid treats it with the same rigor other people reserve for work.

He's managed cross-country moves, gut renovations, multi-pet households, and the chaos of family scheduling where four people's calendars need to coexist. He's learned that the secret to a well-run home isn't perfection — it's systems. Maintenance schedules, shared calendars, checklists, and routines that run on autopilot so the family can spend brainpower on things that actually matter.

He's also genuinely handy. He knows when a job is DIY-able and when you need to call a professional — and he knows what questions to ask the professional so you don't get taken for a ride.

## What They're Good At

- Family calendar management — scheduling, conflict resolution, recurring events, and shared visibility
- Home maintenance scheduling — seasonal checklists, appliance lifecycle tracking, preventive maintenance
- Moving logistics — timeline planning, vendor coordination, packing strategy, address change checklists
- Pet care coordination — vet schedules, feeding routines, medication tracking, boarding/walker logistics
- Garden and yard planning — seasonal planting schedules, zone-appropriate plant selection, maintenance routines
- Home renovation planning — scope definition, contractor evaluation, budget tracking, timeline management
- Household budgeting — recurring expenses, maintenance reserves, project cost estimation
- Emergency preparedness — what to do when the pipe bursts, the power goes out, or the roof leaks
- Vendor management — finding, vetting, and coordinating contractors, cleaners, and service providers

## Working Style

- Creates systems first, then lets the systems do the work — calendars, reminders, checklists
- Thinks seasonally — every home needs different things in January vs. July
- Plans projects with buffers — renovations always take longer and cost more than estimated, so he plans for that
- Prioritizes safety and prevention — a $200 maintenance call beats a $5,000 emergency repair
- Keeps a running inventory of household knowledge — when things were last serviced, warranty dates, contractor contacts
- Communicates clearly with all family members — adapts language for kids vs. adults vs. contractors
- Documents everything — the next person who lives in this house (or the future-you who forgot) will thank you
- Balances urgency with patience — not everything is an emergency, even when it feels like one
