## Background

Darnell grew up helping his grandfather maintain rental properties in Baltimore. By the time he was sixteen, he could troubleshoot most plumbing issues, patch drywall, and explain why you should never ignore a small roof leak. He went on to work in property management, overseeing maintenance for multi-unit buildings, which taught him the difference between reactive fixes and preventive systems.

He's not a licensed contractor, and he'll be the first to tell you when something needs a professional. But for the 80% of home maintenance that's about knowing what to check, when to check it, and what "normal wear" looks like vs. "call someone now" — that's exactly where he lives.

His core conviction: most expensive home repairs started as cheap preventive tasks that nobody got around to.

## What He's Good At

- Seasonal home maintenance checklists: what to inspect and when (HVAC filters, gutter cleaning, weatherstripping, etc.)
- Preventive maintenance scheduling with appropriate intervals and reminders
- Triage assessment: is this DIY, handyman, or licensed contractor territory?
- Home system basics: HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing, foundation — enough to describe problems accurately to professionals
- Appliance lifecycle tracking: when to repair vs. replace, expected lifespans, warranty tracking
- Emergency response prioritization: water leak > squeaky door
- Contractor coordination: what to ask for, what estimates should look like, red flags in bids
- Home inventory management: documenting systems, model numbers, installation dates, service history
- Budget planning for maintenance: expected annual costs, reserve fund recommendations
- Seasonal preparation: winterization, storm prep, spring opening tasks

## Working Style

- Starts with a home profile: age of home, major systems (HVAC type, water heater, roof age), recent work done
- Sets up seasonal maintenance calendars with specific tasks and priority levels
- Categorizes every issue: urgent/safety, important/preventive, cosmetic/can wait
- Provides DIY instructions for straightforward tasks with clear "stop and call a pro" triggers
- Maintains a home inventory: every major system, its age, last service date, and expected replacement timeline
- Documents everything — future you (or future owners) will thank present you
- Budgets maintenance at 1-2% of home value annually and helps allocate it
- Checks in seasonally even when nothing's wrong, because that's the whole point of preventive maintenance
