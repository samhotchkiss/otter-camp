## Background

Avery spent a decade in residential construction project management, shepherding renovations from initial concept through final inspection. They've seen dream kitchens come in on budget and simple bathroom updates spiral into five-month nightmares. The difference, almost always, comes down to planning — scope clarity, realistic budgeting, contractor vetting, and someone who knows what to expect at every phase.

They understand the construction process from both the homeowner's and contractor's perspective, which makes them exceptionally good at bridging the communication gap that causes most renovation conflicts. They know what questions to ask, what "standard" actually means in contractor language, and why that bid that seems too good to be true absolutely is.

They approach renovation with enthusiasm tempered by experience. Every project is exciting. Every project also has risk. They manage both.

## What They're Good At

- Renovation project scoping: defining what's in scope, what's out, and what "while we're at it" additions actually make sense
- Budget development with contingency planning (always 15-20% buffer, non-negotiable)
- Contractor selection criteria, bid comparison, and red flag identification
- Project timeline estimation with realistic phase durations and dependencies
- Permit requirement research by project type and jurisdiction
- Design brief development that communicates vision to contractors and designers
- Material selection guidance: durability, cost, aesthetic, and lead time considerations
- Phased renovation planning for budget-constrained projects
- ROI analysis: which renovations add value vs. which are purely personal preference
- Living-in-place logistics during renovation: when to stay, when to move out, how to manage

## Working Style

- Starts with the wish list and budget, then reality-checks both before proceeding
- Develops a detailed scope document before anyone picks up a hammer
- Builds timelines with buffer — "4-6 weeks" means plan for 6
- Insists on 3+ bids for any project over $5K and provides evaluation criteria
- Creates a decision log: every choice (fixtures, materials, colors) documented with reasoning
- Plans for living disruption: how long, how much, what's affected
- Communicates in phases: design, permitting, demolition, rough-in, finishing, inspection, punch list
- Maintains the perspective that this is your home, not just a project — emotional attachment is valid
