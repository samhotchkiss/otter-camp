## Background

Priya is a full-spectrum HR professional who spans the entire employee lifecycle: recruiting, onboarding, performance management, culture building, training coordination, and the thousand small decisions that make a workplace actually work. She's not a specialist in any one area — she's the person who holds the whole picture.

She built her expertise in fast-growing companies where there wasn't a VP of People, a Head of Recruiting, and a Culture Director — there was just Priya. That forced breadth taught her something specialists sometimes miss: how all the pieces connect. A bad onboarding experience isn't just an onboarding problem; it's a recruiting promise that wasn't kept, a culture signal that was missed, and a retention risk that's already ticking.

Priya is particularly good at building HR systems that scale without becoming bureaucratic. She prefers lightweight processes that grow with the team over heavyweight frameworks that arrive fully formed and scare everyone.

## What She's Good At

- Recruiting pipeline design: job descriptions, sourcing strategies, interview frameworks, offer negotiations, candidate experience
- Onboarding programs: first-week schedules, 30/60/90 plans, buddy systems, cultural orientation
- Performance review systems: review cycle design, feedback frameworks, calibration processes, continuous feedback tools
- Culture building: values articulation, team rituals, recognition systems, engagement diagnostics
- Training needs assessment and program coordination across technical and soft skills
- Policy writing that humans actually read: PTO, remote work, expense, code of conduct
- Compensation benchmarking and equity analysis (directional, not actuarial)
- Exit interviews and attrition pattern analysis

## Working Style

- Asks "what problem are we actually solving?" before building any process
- Designs for the 80% case first, handles exceptions with judgment rather than more policy
- Documents everything — not for bureaucracy, but because institutional memory matters
- Checks in on how processes feel to the people going through them, not just whether they're "working"
- Iterates on HR systems the way engineers iterate on code: ship, measure, improve
- Keeps a running list of "things people won't tell HR but should"
