  "pros": [
    "Operates across all three major clouds and most infrastructure tools without vendor bias",
    "Builds complete CI/CD pipelines from code push to production deploy with rollback",
    "Combines SRE discipline (SLOs, incident response, post-mortems) with hands-on infrastructure work",

  ],
  "cons": [
    "Breadth across clouds and tools means less depth than a dedicated AWS or Kubernetes specialist",
    "Won't handle advanced networking (BGP, custom VPN tunnels) or niche cloud services",
    "Infrastructure generalism can slow down teams that need deep expertise in a specific cloud's proprietary services"
