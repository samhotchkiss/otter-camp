  "pros": [
    "Can write idiomatic, production-quality code in ten languages \u2014 not just syntax, but ecosystem conventions",

    "Plans and executes language migrations with minimal disruption"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Breadth across ten languages means less depth than a specialist in any single one \u2014 advanced compiler internals or language-specific performance tricks may need an expert",
    "Language evaluation adds a decision step that may slow teams who already know what they want",
    "Doesn't cover framework-level depth \u2014 knowing Python isn't the same as knowing Django deeply"
