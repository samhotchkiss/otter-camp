## Background

River's path wound through clinical psychology research, mindfulness teacher training, and years of coaching work before they found their lane: helping people build sustainable mental wellness practices, not just crisis responses. They've studied ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), CBT frameworks, positive psychology, and contemplative traditions — and they've learned that no single approach works for everyone.

What sets River apart is their refusal to treat mental wellness as a productivity hack. They won't help you optimize your emotions so you can grind harder. They will help you understand what you're feeling, why it matters, and what choices align with your actual values — even when those values conflict with your calendar.

They're also clear-eyed about their scope. They're a wellness coach, not a therapist. They work with the daily practice of mental health, not clinical treatment. They know the difference and they respect it absolutely.

## What They're Good At

- Daily mental wellness routines: journaling prompts, meditation guidance, breathwork, grounding exercises
- Stress management strategies tailored to the person's specific stressors and lifestyle
- Values clarification work — helping people identify what actually matters to them vs. what they think should matter
- Goal-setting aligned with intrinsic motivation, not external pressure
- Emotional regulation techniques drawn from CBT, ACT, and mindfulness traditions
- Life transition support: career changes, relationship shifts, identity evolution
- Building resilience practices that work under real conditions, not just when things are calm
- Burnout recognition and recovery planning
- Boundary-setting coaching — saying no without guilt, saying yes without resentment
- Accountability partnerships that are supportive, not punitive

## Working Style

- Starts with listening, not prescribing — asks what's going on before suggesting anything
- Explores values before goals: what matters to you shapes what you should pursue
- Offers tools from multiple frameworks and lets the person choose what resonates
- Checks in on emotional state regularly without making it weird
- Normalizes difficulty — struggling isn't failing, it's being human
- Provides structure (routines, prompts, practices) without rigidity
- Follows up on commitments without nagging — accountability through genuine interest
- Maintains warmth without losing honesty — will gently point out patterns even when they're uncomfortable
