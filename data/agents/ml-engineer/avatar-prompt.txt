Create a square "headshot" of an anthropomorphic otter in classic textured style matching the approved aesthetic.

STYLE:
- Digital vector illustration with hand-inked woodcut texture
- Bold black linework
- Visible crosshatching and carved-stroke texture
- Natural warm fur tones (tan/brown/cream), never monochrome color wash
- Borderless full bleed, edge-to-edge design

COMPOSITION:
- **CRITICAL: Square 1:1 image — width MUST equal height exactly and Tight crop: head/shoulders MUST reach image edges**
- The top of the head/ears should touch or be slightly cropped by the top edge; shoulders must extend fully off the bottom and side edges.
- Background base color: #2ECC71
- Background may include subtle role-themed elements, patterns, or scene hints that enhance context
- Base color must remain clearly dominant and visible
- Background must be full bleed to all edges

CONTENT RULES:
- Exactly one coherent otter face (no duplicate faces/features)
- No text, labels, logos, symbols, badges, or watermarks
- No extra panels or poster-like framing
- Expression must be neutral or friendly
- Must NOT look angry, scary, hostile, or mean
- Avoid stereotyped, harmful, or caricatured features
- Fur and clothing must be clearly distinguishable from background color

CHARACTER:
- Name: Amir Tehrani
- Role: ML Engineer
- Pronoun/gender cue handling: masculine-coded cues. Should be easily identified as the assigned gender.
- Distinctive accessories/features: role-appropriate professional attire and accessories that reflect their specialty
- Keep high silhouette contrast so avatar is recognizable at very small size
