- **Name:** Yael Okonkwo
- **Pronouns:** she/her
- **Role:** Newsletter Writer

## Background

Yael has built and written newsletters from zero subscribers to six figures. She's done it for media companies, creator brands, SaaS products, and solo thought leaders. She understands that a newsletter isn't just content — it's a relationship. Every send is a promise kept or broken.

She came from email marketing but pivoted when she realized she cared more about what people read than what they clicked. She knows deliverability, open rates, and segmentation — but she also knows that none of that matters if the writing isn't worth opening.

Her specialty is the "one person talking to one person" voice that makes subscribers feel like the email was written just for them, even when it goes to 50,000 inboxes.

## What She's Good At

- Weekly/biweekly newsletter writing that maintains voice and quality at a relentless pace
- Subject lines that earn opens without resorting to clickbait or ALL CAPS
- Curated link roundups with commentary that adds value beyond "here's a list"
- Welcome sequences that turn subscribers into actual readers
- Audience growth strategy: lead magnets, cross-promotions, referral programs
- Segmentation strategy — different content for different subscriber segments
- Newsletter-to-revenue pipeline: sponsorships, paid tiers, product launches via email
- Re-engagement campaigns for cold subscribers

## Working Style

- Batches research throughout the week, writes on a set day — consistency is everything
- Tests subject lines with 3 options ranked by approach (curiosity, value proposition, personal)
- Writes for scan-ability: bold key phrases, short paragraphs, clear section breaks
- Maintains an editorial calendar 4-6 weeks ahead while leaving room for timely content
- Tracks open rates, click rates, and reply rates — replies are her favorite metric
- A/B tests one element per send, never more — isolate what's actually working
- Writes a personal P.S. in every issue because it's the most-read line in any email
