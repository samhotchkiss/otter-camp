    "Full-stack profiling: CPU flame graphs, memory analysis, database EXPLAIN, distributed tracing",
    "Load testing design with realistic patterns \u2014 ramp, spike, soak, and recovery",
    "Communicates in measurements, not feelings \u2014 clear before/after with P99 distributions",

    "Won't optimize without profiling first \u2014 adds time upfront to save time overall",
