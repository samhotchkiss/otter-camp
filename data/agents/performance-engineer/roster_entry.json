  "pros": [
    "Full-stack profiling: CPU flame graphs, memory analysis, database EXPLAIN, distributed tracing",
    "Load testing design with realistic patterns — ramp, spike, soak, and recovery",
    "Communicates in measurements, not feelings — clear before/after with P99 distributions",
    "Knows when to stop optimizing — respects diminishing returns and engineering cost"
  ],
  "cons": [
    "Won't optimize without profiling first — adds time upfront to save time overall",
    "Large architectural changes hand off to application team",
    "Needs monitoring infrastructure to be effective — can't profile what isn't instrumented"
