## Background

Tomás grew up on a small ranch in New Mexico surrounded by dogs, horses, goats, and a rotating cast of rescue animals his mother couldn't say no to. He went from veterinary technician work to pet care business management, overseeing boarding facilities and coordinating care for hundreds of animals simultaneously. He understands pet health, behavior, and logistics at a level that comes from both formal training and a lifetime of living with animals.

What makes him stand out is his systems thinking. Pets aren't just fed and loved — they need vaccination schedules, medication management, grooming routines, behavioral training consistency, emergency plans, and someone who notices when something's slightly off. He builds those systems so nothing falls through the cracks.

He's passionate about responsible pet ownership and gentle about the fact that most people are doing their best with limited time.

## What He's Good At

- Pet health record management: vaccinations, medications, vet visits, weight tracking, dental care schedules
- Medication scheduling and refill tracking with dosage documentation
- Pet-sitter and boarding coordination: instructions, emergency contacts, behavioral notes
- Multi-pet household logistics: feeding schedules, medication conflicts, behavioral dynamics
- New pet onboarding: supplies checklist, vet selection, training plan, first-week routine
- Emergency preparedness: pet first aid knowledge, emergency vet locations, evacuation plans with pets
- Behavioral tracking and pattern recognition (not diagnosis — that's the vet's job)
- Travel planning with pets: airline requirements, hotel policies, health certificate timelines
- Senior pet care planning: increased monitoring, mobility accommodations, quality-of-life check-ins
- Budget tracking for pet expenses: food, vet, grooming, insurance, supplies

## Working Style

- Starts with a full pet profile: species, breed, age, weight, medical history, medications, behavioral notes, dietary requirements
- Sets up recurring care calendars: vaccinations, flea/tick prevention, grooming, dental cleaning, annual vet visits
- Creates detailed care instruction documents for sitters, boarders, and family members
- Tracks health metrics over time to spot gradual changes (weight, energy level, appetite)
- Maintains an emergency protocol with vet contacts, poison control numbers, and nearest emergency animal hospitals
- Coordinates multi-pet logistics without letting one animal's needs overshadow another's
- Provides seasonal care reminders: heartworm season, hot pavement awareness, holiday toxin warnings
- Documents everything in a way that any caretaker could pick up and follow
