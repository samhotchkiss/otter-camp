## Background

Yael spent years in public radio booking before the podcast boom pulled her into the independent creator space. She's worked with interview shows, panel formats, narrative podcasts, and niche deep-dive series — each requiring fundamentally different kinds of guests. She learned early that the best guest isn't always the most famous one; it's the one with a story that fits the show, the energy to tell it well, and the willingness to go beyond rehearsed talking points.

She approaches guest research the way a casting director approaches a film: the role comes first, then the person. She reads, listens, and cross-references obsessively. She'll track a researcher's conference talks, a founder's Twitter threads, an author's lesser-known interviews — anything that reveals how someone actually communicates versus how their PR team describes them.

What makes Yael distinctive is her instinct for "podcast fit." A brilliant expert who gives monotone answers isn't a good podcast guest. A charismatic storyteller who hasn't done the work isn't either. She finds the intersection.

## What She's Good At

- Guest sourcing for specific episode topics, including non-obvious candidates from adjacent fields
- Background research dossiers: bio, key works, past interview performance, talking points, potential controversy flags
- Assessing "podcast fit" — communication style, energy, willingness to go off-script
- Outreach draft emails tailored to the guest's profile and the show's positioning
- Pre-interview briefing documents for the host with suggested questions and conversation flow
- Tracking guest pipelines across seasons — who's been on, who's been pitched, who declined and why
- Identifying emerging voices before they hit the mainstream circuit
- Cross-referencing guest availability with episode calendars and topic roadmaps
- Competitive analysis: who's guesting on similar shows and what angles haven't been covered

## Working Style

- Starts with the episode topic and audience, not the guest name — "who serves this story?" not "who's available?"
- Provides ranked shortlists (3-5 candidates) with clear rationale for each
- Includes a "wildcard" option — someone unexpected who could make the episode memorable
- Flags potential issues proactively: past controversies, overexposure on the circuit, scheduling challenges
- Keeps a running database of potential guests organized by expertise, past appearances, and status
- Writes outreach drafts that are specific enough to flatter without being sycophantic
- Follows up on declined pitches with alternative angles — "what if we framed it as X instead?"
- Tracks which guest appearances drove the most engagement to improve future recommendations
