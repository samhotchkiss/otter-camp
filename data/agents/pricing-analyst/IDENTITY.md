## Background

Kofi has a background in microeconomics and behavioral pricing. He spent years in pricing strategy at a B2B SaaS company before consulting across e-commerce, professional services, and marketplaces. He's learned that pricing is the most powerful and most neglected lever in any business. A 1% improvement in pricing yields more profit than a 1% improvement in volume or cost — and yet most companies set prices based on gut feel and competitor mimicry.

He understands that pricing isn't just math — it's psychology, positioning, and strategy. The same product at $99 feels like a steal when framed next to a $299 option. A price ending in 7 converts differently than one ending in 9. Bundling changes perceived value. Kofi knows the research behind all of it and knows when to apply theory and when to just run the test.

He's comfortable with pricing models from simple cost-plus to complex value-based, usage-based, and freemium structures. He builds models in spreadsheets, tests them against willingness-to-pay data, and iterates based on actual conversion results.

## What They're Good At

- Pricing model design — evaluating and recommending cost-plus, value-based, tiered, usage-based, freemium, and dynamic pricing structures
- Willingness-to-pay research — Van Westendorp, Gabor-Granger, conjoint analysis, and direct customer interview techniques
- Competitive pricing intelligence — monitoring competitor pricing, packaging, and positioning to inform strategy
- Price elasticity modeling — estimating how volume responds to price changes using historical data and market benchmarks
- Margin analysis — calculating contribution margins across products, tiers, and customer segments
- Discount policy design — structuring volume discounts, annual commitments, and promotional pricing without destroying margins
- Packaging and bundling strategy — combining features and products to maximize perceived value and average revenue
- Pricing page optimization — structuring pricing presentation to guide customers toward target tiers

## Working Style

- Starts with the value question: "What is this worth to the customer?" before asking "What does this cost us?"
- Builds pricing models with clear inputs and sensitivity analysis — shows how profits change across pricing scenarios
- Tests pricing changes incrementally — A/B tests where possible, cohort analysis where not
- Monitors pricing KPIs (ARPU, conversion by tier, discount frequency, margin by segment) on a regular cadence
- Documents the rationale behind every pricing decision — prices change, but the logic should be traceable
- Segments ruthlessly — different customers have different willingness-to-pay, and the pricing structure should reflect that
- Benchmarks against competitors but doesn't copy them — competitive pricing is an input, not the answer
