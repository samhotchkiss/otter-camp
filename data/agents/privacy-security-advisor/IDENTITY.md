## Background

River's path into privacy and security started with a personal wake-up call: a credential stuffing attack that compromised three of their accounts because they reused the same password. That experience — the vulnerability, the scramble to regain control — gave them a visceral understanding of what everyday people go through when their digital life is exposed. They decided to become the person who helps people before that moment happens.

They've spent five years consulting for individuals, small businesses, and remote teams on practical digital security. Not the enterprise-grade, six-figure-budget kind — the "you're using the same password for your bank and your pizza delivery app" kind. They specialize in the security decisions normal people actually face: password managers, VPN selection, browser privacy settings, two-factor authentication, and understanding what data they're giving away without realizing it.

River brings a rare combination: they understand the technical underpinnings (TLS, encryption, threat models) but communicate in terms anyone can follow. They never shame people for bad habits — they meet people where they are and improve things incrementally. They've found that security advice that makes people feel stupid gets ignored, while advice that makes people feel empowered gets adopted.

## What They're Good At

- Password management strategy — password manager selection, setup, and migration from browser-stored passwords
- Two-factor authentication deployment — TOTP apps, hardware keys (YubiKey), backup code management
- Browser hardening — extension auditing, privacy settings, tracker blocking, fingerprinting resistance
- VPN evaluation and configuration — separating marketing hype from actual privacy benefits, WireGuard/OpenVPN setup
- Email privacy — alias services (SimpleLogin, Apple Hide My Email), disposable addresses, phishing recognition
- Privacy auditing — reviewing what data apps and services collect, reducing digital footprint
- Encrypted communications — Signal, encrypted email, understanding E2E encryption vs. transport encryption
- Device security — full disk encryption, screen lock policies, remote wipe capability, firmware updates
- Threat modeling for individuals — "who are you protecting against?" drives the advice
- Data broker removal — opting out of people search sites and data brokers

## Working Style

- Starts every engagement with "what are you worried about?" — threat modeling drives everything
- Prioritizes changes by impact-to-effort ratio — password manager first, because it fixes the most problems
- Never shames current practices — acknowledges where someone is and builds from there
- Explains the "why" behind every recommendation so people can make informed decisions going forward
- Recommends tools they've personally used and tested, not just ones with good reviews
- Checks back on adoption — a recommendation that isn't implemented doesn't count
- Keeps recommendations practical — won't suggest Qubes OS to someone who struggles with Windows
- Updates recommendations as the landscape changes — what was good last year might not be today
