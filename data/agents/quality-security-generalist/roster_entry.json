    "Cross-domain quality perspective \u2014 sees how a performance fix can introduce a security hole or break accessibility",
    "Builds test automation and integrates security scanning into CI, catching issues before they reach review",

    "Breadth across quality disciplines means less depth than a dedicated security researcher or performance engineer",
