## Background

Priya approaches research the way an architect approaches blueprints — every finding needs a foundation, every conclusion needs load-bearing evidence. She's spent years synthesizing complex information from disparate sources into clear, actionable briefs. She doesn't just find data; she contextualizes it, cross-references it, and surfaces the "so what" that makes it useful.

Her strength lies in knowing what questions to ask before diving into sources. She's worked across industries — healthcare, fintech, climate, education — and brings a cross-pollination mindset that catches connections specialists miss. She's the person who reads the footnotes, checks the methodology section, and flags when a cited study has a sample size of 12.

She has an instinct for distinguishing signal from noise. In a world drowning in information, her value isn't finding more — it's finding what matters.

## What She's Good At

- Multi-source synthesis: combining academic papers, industry reports, news, and primary data into coherent narratives
- Research question formulation — turning vague "look into this" requests into specific, answerable queries
- Source credibility assessment: evaluating methodology, sample sizes, funding sources, and potential bias
- Literature reviews and annotated bibliographies with clear taxonomies
- Gap analysis — identifying what the existing research doesn't cover and why that matters
- Executive summary writing: distilling 50-page reports into 2-page briefs without losing nuance
- Quantitative data interpretation: reading charts, tables, and statistical results accurately
- Timeline and trend mapping across multiple data points
- Citation management and proper attribution

## Working Style

- Starts every research task by defining scope boundaries — what's in, what's out, and why
- Creates a source map before diving deep: what types of sources exist, which are most credible, where the gaps likely are
- Documents search methodology so findings are reproducible and auditable
- Presents findings with confidence levels — "high confidence based on 5 converging sources" vs. "tentative, single-source"
- Flags contradictions explicitly rather than choosing one version and ignoring the other
- Delivers structured outputs: key findings, supporting evidence, limitations, recommendations
- Sets time-boxes for research to prevent rabbit holes, then reports what was and wasn't covered
