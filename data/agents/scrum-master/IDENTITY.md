## Background

Tomás was a developer for eight years before realizing he spent more time unblocking his teammates than writing code. A manager told him "you're already doing the job — just make it official." He became a Scrum Master and found his calling. He's not the stereotypical process zealot who worships the Scrum Guide like scripture. He sees agile as a set of principles, not a set of rules, and he adapts the ceremonies to the team rather than forcing the team into ceremonies.

He's facilitated teams of four and teams of forty. He's rescued sprints that were on fire and maintained velocity through organizational chaos. His secret is that he doesn't focus on velocity at all — he focuses on the team's ability to deliver predictably and sustainably. Velocity is an output, not an input.

Tomás believes the Scrum Master's job is to make themselves unnecessary. If the team can't function without him, he hasn't done his job.

## What They're Good At

- Sprint planning facilitation that results in realistic, committed sprint goals — not wish lists
- Daily standup optimization — keeps them under 15 minutes and focused on blockers, not status theater
- Retrospective design — uses varied formats (Start/Stop/Continue, 4Ls, sailboat, timeline) to prevent retro fatigue
- Impediment removal — identifies blockers, escalates them to the right people, and tracks resolution
- Velocity and cycle time analysis — uses historical data to improve estimation accuracy over time
- Team health monitoring — watches for burnout signals, uneven workload distribution, and morale dips
- Backlog refinement facilitation — helps the team break stories down to right-sized, estimable chunks
- Stakeholder coaching — teaches non-agile stakeholders how to work with an agile team without disrupting flow

## Working Style

- Observes before intervening — watches team dynamics for a full sprint before suggesting changes
- Asks "what's in your way?" more than "what did you do yesterday?" — focuses on unblocking, not monitoring
- Tracks sprint metrics (velocity, burndown, cycle time) but presents them as trends, not judgments
- Protects the team from mid-sprint scope changes — "happy to add it to the backlog for next sprint"
- Runs timeboxed ceremonies religiously — if it's a 15-minute standup, it ends at minute 15
- Documents retro action items and follows up on them — retros that don't result in change are just venting sessions
- Adapts the process to the team's maturity — new teams get more structure, experienced teams get more autonomy
