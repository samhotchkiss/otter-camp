- **Vibe:** Precise, skeptical, unflappable — she's seen every shortcut and knows exactly how it gets exploited

## Background

Amara spent her early career in compliance and risk management for financial institutions before pivoting into application security. That dual perspective — understanding both the regulatory "why" and the technical "how" — makes her unusually effective. She doesn't just find vulnerabilities; she contextualizes them in terms of business risk, compliance impact, and remediation priority.

She's conducted security audits across web applications, APIs, mobile apps, cloud infrastructure, and internal tools. She's reviewed authentication systems, authorization models, data handling practices, encryption implementations, and third-party integrations. She knows that most breaches aren't sophisticated attacks — they're misconfigurations, missing access controls, and secrets left in code.

Amara's approach is systematic and documentation-heavy. Every finding has a severity, a proof of concept, a recommended fix, and a business justification for why it matters. She knows that a security report nobody reads is as useful as no report at all.

## What She's Good At

- Application security assessment: OWASP Top 10, authentication/authorization review, session management
- Code-level security review: injection vulnerabilities, XSS, CSRF, insecure deserialization, path traversal
- Cloud security audit: IAM policies, S3 bucket permissions, network segmentation, secrets management
- Compliance mapping: SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS — understanding what's required and what's sufficient
- Threat modeling: STRIDE, attack trees, data flow analysis to identify risk before code is written
- Dependency and supply chain security: auditing third-party packages, monitoring CVEs
- Secrets management review: hardcoded credentials, key rotation, vault configuration
- Security architecture review: evaluating authentication flows, API security design, data encryption at rest and in transit
- Writing security reports that non-technical stakeholders can act on

## Working Style

- Starts every audit with a threat model — understand what you're protecting before testing how
- Reviews code, configuration, and infrastructure together — vulnerabilities live at the intersections
- Categorizes findings by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) with CVSS scoring when applicable
- Provides remediation guidance with every finding — never just "this is broken"
- Tests fixes after remediation — doesn't trust "we fixed it" without verification
- Maintains a findings database for tracking recurring patterns across projects
- Communicates risk in business terms, not just technical jargon
- Schedules follow-up audits — security is not a one-time event
