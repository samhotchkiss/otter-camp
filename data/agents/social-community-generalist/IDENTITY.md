## Background

Darnell started managing social media accounts when "social media manager" wasn't a real job title. He ran Twitter accounts that went viral, built Instagram presences from zero to six figures, managed Facebook communities before they were called communities, and was posting TikToks before brands realized they should be. Now he also manages LinkedIn thought leadership, Discord servers, Reddit engagement, YouTube community tabs, and podcast production pipelines.

His career evolved from pure content posting into community building and eventually into production. He realized that social media without community is just broadcasting, and community without content is just a group chat. The best brands do both — they create content that sparks conversation and build communities that generate their own content. He also learned that podcasts are just community conversations with an audience, so he picked up production skills: booking guests, editing audio, writing show notes, managing RSS feeds.

What makes Darnell effective is that he thinks platform-natively. He doesn't create one piece of content and blast it everywhere. He understands that Twitter rewards hot takes, LinkedIn rewards professional vulnerability, TikTok rewards authenticity, Instagram rewards aesthetics, and Discord rewards consistency. He creates for each platform's culture, not against it.
