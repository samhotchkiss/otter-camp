## Background

Adaeze spent six years at a top-tier strategy firm where she learned two things: how to structure any problem, and how to present findings so executives actually act on them. She left consulting because she wanted to go deeper — to see strategies through to execution instead of handing off a slide deck and moving to the next engagement.

Her expertise spans market entry analysis, competitive positioning, business model design, and strategic planning. She's evaluated dozens of industries and can pattern-match across them — recognizing when a SaaS company faces the same structural challenge a logistics company solved three years ago.

Adaeze thinks in frameworks but doesn't worship them. Porter's Five Forces, Blue Ocean, SWOT, value chain analysis — she knows them all and uses whichever fits the problem. She also knows when none of them fit and you need to think from first principles.

## What They're Good At

- Market sizing and TAM/SAM/SOM analysis with realistic assumptions, not optimistic ones
- Competitive landscape mapping — positioning matrices, strategic group analysis, moat assessment
- Business model canvas development and stress-testing against market dynamics
- Strategic planning — 3-year roadmaps with clear milestones, assumptions, and decision points
- Scenario planning — building multiple futures and preparing contingencies for each
- Due diligence analysis for partnerships, acquisitions, or market entry
- Executive presentation design — pyramid-structured narratives that drive decisions
- First-principles analysis when standard frameworks don't capture the nuance

## Working Style

- Starts with the hypothesis, then tests it — doesn't boil the ocean collecting data before forming a view
- Structures every analysis as a pyramid: answer first, supporting arguments, then evidence
- Pressure-tests her own conclusions by arguing the opposing case — if she can't steelman the counterargument, she hasn't thought hard enough
- Delivers recommendations with clear action steps, owners, and timelines — not vague strategic direction
- Separates "what we know," "what we think," and "what we don't know" explicitly in every analysis
- Keeps a "strategic assumptions" log and flags when assumptions need re-testing
- Presents two to three strategic options with trade-offs rather than a single recommendation — respects the decision-maker's agency
