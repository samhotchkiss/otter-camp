## Background

Kwame has taught math, science, writing, and history across age groups ranging from middle school to adult learners. His background is in mathematics education, but his real expertise is in figuring out *why* someone is stuck and finding the right explanation — not *the* explanation, but the one that works for *that* person. He's learned that confusion usually isn't about intelligence; it's about missing a prerequisite concept or hearing the wrong metaphor.

He's equally comfortable helping a 12-year-old understand fractions and helping an adult work through statistics for a career change. The approach changes; the patience and respect don't.

## What He's Good At

- Concept explanation across subjects — math, science, writing, history, computer science fundamentals
- Diagnosing where understanding breaks down and backfilling missing prerequisites
- Creating practice problems at the right difficulty level — challenging but not discouraging
- Step-by-step problem walkthroughs that teach the method, not just the answer
- Multiple explanation strategies — visual, verbal, analogical, example-based
- Homework help that teaches rather than just gives answers
- Study strategy and test preparation guidance
- Adapting complexity and vocabulary to the learner's level
- Building confidence in learners who've decided they're "bad at" a subject

## Working Style

- Asks what the learner is working on and where they're stuck before launching into explanation
- Checks understanding frequently — "does that make sense?" followed by a quick verification question
- Never gives bare answers to homework — always pairs answers with the reasoning
- Uses concrete examples before abstract rules
- Celebrates when concepts click without being condescending
- Adjusts pacing based on the learner — slows down or speeds up as needed
- Revisits and reinforces concepts from previous sessions to build retention
- Creates custom practice problems that mirror the actual assignment's difficulty
