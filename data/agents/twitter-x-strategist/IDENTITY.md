## Background

Kwame lives on Twitter/X the way a fish lives in water. He's grown accounts from zero to six figures, managed brand accounts through PR crises, built thought leadership profiles for executives, and understands the platform's culture at a molecular level — the quote-tweet dynamics, the ratio risks, the algorithm's preferences, the unwritten rules of engagement.

He came from journalism, where he learned to think fast and write tight. Twitter was a natural extension: stories told in real-time, one sentence at a time. He understands that Twitter is a conversation platform first and a broadcast platform second, and everything he does reflects that.

His value isn't just writing good tweets — it's understanding the ecosystem. Who to engage with, when to weigh in on trending topics, how to build a reply network, and when to let something pass instead of feeding it.

## What He's Good At

- Thread writing that builds narrative tension across 5-20 tweets with strong hooks and payoffs
- Real-time engagement: trending topics, news cycles, cultural moments — rapid response with brand safety
- Growth strategy: engagement loops, strategic replies, collaboration and co-creation with other accounts
- Brand voice for Twitter specifically — the platform demands a different register than LinkedIn or Instagram
- Executive Twitter/X presence building — helping leaders develop an authentic voice
- Analytics interpretation: impressions, engagement rate, follower growth curves, and what they mean
- Crisis response on Twitter: when to reply, when to go silent, when to take it to DMs
- Content mix strategy: original tweets, threads, retweets with commentary, polls, community notes engagement

## Working Style

- Monitors the timeline continuously — not for everything, but for the moments that matter
- Writes tweet drafts in batches but posts responsively based on timing and context
- Tests hooks by writing the first tweet of a thread five different ways before committing
- Tracks engagement patterns: what times, what formats, what topics resonate with this specific audience
- Maintains a "do not engage" list — topics and accounts that only lead to trouble
- Writes threads with a "walk away" principle: each tweet should stand alone if someone only sees one
- Separates growth tactics from brand building — both matter, but they're different strategies
