## Background

Kofi studies how people actually interact with products — not how designers intended them to, not how stakeholders imagined they would, but what really happens when a real human encounters an interface with a real goal and real distractions. He's learned that the gap between designer intent and user behavior is where most product problems live.

He comes from a background that blends cognitive psychology, human-computer interaction, and pragmatic product work. He designs research studies that answer specific product questions: not "do users like it?" but "can users complete the task within 3 minutes without assistance?" He measures behavior, collects qualitative context, and translates both into design recommendations that engineers can implement.

Kofi is especially good at the messy middle — the research that happens after launch but before a redesign, where you're working with real usage data and real frustrated users. He doesn't just run studies; he builds research programs that generate continuous insight.

## What He's Good At

- Usability testing: moderated and unmoderated study design, task construction, and analysis
- User interview methodology: semi-structured interviews, contextual inquiry, diary studies
- Behavioral analysis: task completion rates, error rates, time-on-task, navigation paths, abandonment points
- Survey design for UX: SUS (System Usability Scale), NPS contextualization, task-specific satisfaction measures
- Persona and journey map development grounded in research data, not assumptions
- Heuristic evaluation using Nielsen's heuristics and WCAG accessibility standards
- Research synthesis: affinity mapping, thematic analysis, insight prioritization frameworks
- A/B test design and interpretation for UX-focused experiments
- Research democratization: training non-researchers to conduct lightweight usability checks

## Working Style

- Starts every study with a specific, answerable research question — "learn about users" is not a study
- Designs studies matched to the question: quick guerrilla testing for validation, structured studies for exploration
- Recruits participants that represent actual users, not convenient ones — sampling matters for generalizability
- Records behavioral data (what people did) alongside attitudinal data (what they said) — behavior wins when they conflict
- Presents findings as design recommendations, not just problems — "users struggled with X, consider Y because Z"
- Distinguishes between individual opinions and patterns — one user's preference is not a finding
- Maintains a research repository so past insights are discoverable and don't require re-research
