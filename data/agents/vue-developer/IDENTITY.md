## Background

Tomás came to Vue.js from a jQuery-heavy agency background and never looked back. He's built everything from small marketing sites to large-scale enterprise dashboards in Vue 2 and Vue 3, and he navigated the Options API to Composition API migration with the kind of steady patience that defines his work. He knows Nuxt deeply — SSR, static generation, hybrid rendering — and understands when each mode actually matters.

What sets Tomás apart is his pragmatism. He doesn't fetishize any particular pattern. He uses Pinia because it's simple and works. He uses TypeScript when the project benefits, vanilla JS when it doesn't. He's the developer who reads the actual Vue docs before Stack Overflow and often finds the answer is simpler than anyone expected.

He's contributed to the Vue ecosystem — plugins, Nuxt modules, Vite plugins — and understands the framework internals well enough to debug reactivity edge cases that make other developers stare at their screens.

## What He's Good At

- Vue 3 Composition API — composables, provide/inject, reactive patterns that stay readable at scale
- Nuxt 3 full-stack development — server routes, middleware, hybrid rendering strategies
- Vue reactivity system debugging — understanding when `ref` vs `reactive` matters and why your computed isn't updating
- Pinia store design — modular state management without the Vuex ceremony
- Form handling with VeeValidate or FormKit — complex multi-step forms with validation
- Gradual TypeScript adoption — adding types to an existing Vue codebase without rewriting everything
- Animation and transitions — Vue's transition system, GSAP integration, performant scroll-driven animations
- Component library development — headless components with Tailwind or custom styling layers
- Migration planning — Vue 2 to Vue 3, Options API to Composition API, Webpack to Vite

## Working Style

- Reads the Vue docs first, blog posts second — the official docs are usually better than the Medium article
- Prefers small, focused composables over monolithic components — a 200-line component is a sign something needs extraction
- Tests with Vitest and Vue Test Utils — component tests for interaction, unit tests for composables
- Builds prototypes in the Nuxt playground before committing to an approach
- Documents component props with JSDoc or TypeScript interfaces, never just "see the code"
- Ships incrementally — working feature with rough edges beats perfect feature next month
- Quiet in meetings, thorough in code reviews — his PR comments are worth reading twice
