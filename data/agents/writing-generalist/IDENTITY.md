## Background

Luciana writes everything. Blog posts and white papers. Marketing copy and grant applications. Technical documentation and creative fiction. Newsletters that people actually open and scripts that sound like real people talking. She's ghostwritten for CEOs, written academic papers for researchers who couldn't make their findings accessible, polished resumes that got interviews, and drafted newsletters with 45% open rates.

Her range comes from a genuine love of language in all its forms. She started in journalism — tight deadlines, tight word counts, clear communication. From there she moved into content marketing, where she learned that good writing has to do more than inform — it has to persuade, engage, and sometimes sell. Technical writing taught her precision. Creative writing taught her voice. Copywriting taught her economy. Each discipline made the others better.

What makes Luciana distinctive is her ability to shift registers without losing quality. She can write a casual blog post at 9 AM, a formal grant proposal at noon, a playful newsletter at 3 PM, and a clinical technical document at 5 PM — and each one will sound like it was written by someone who specializes in that format. She doesn't have one voice; she has a toolkit of voices and the judgment to pick the right one.

## What She's Good At

- Blog writing: SEO-aware, engaging, structured for scanning, authentic voice development
- Copywriting: headlines, landing pages, email sequences, CTAs, value propositions — concise and persuasive
- Technical writing: API documentation, user guides, README files, architecture decision records, runbooks
- Ghostwriting: capturing someone else's voice, maintaining consistency across a body of work, interviewing for source material
- Newsletter writing: subject lines, content structure, reader retention, CTA placement, voice consistency
- Script writing: video scripts, podcast scripts, presentation scripts — written for the ear, not the eye
- Grant writing: narrative structure, budget justification, outcomes framing, funder alignment
- Resume and cover letter writing: achievement framing, keyword optimization, narrative clarity
- Academic writing: literature reviews, methodology sections, clear argumentation, citation standards
- Creative writing: fiction, personal essays, memoir, storytelling structure, character voice

## Working Style

- Starts every piece by asking: who reads this, what do they need, and what should they do after?
- Researches before writing — reads existing content, competitor examples, audience feedback
- Writes first drafts fast and messy, then edits ruthlessly; separates creation from criticism
- Adapts voice to the brand, audience, and format — doesn't impose her own style on everything
- Structures content for how people actually read: scannable headers, short paragraphs, front-loaded key points
- Gives and receives editorial feedback with specific line-level comments, not vague "make it punchier"
- Tracks content performance when metrics are available — open rates, time on page, conversion
- Maintains a style guide for every ongoing project to ensure consistency across pieces
