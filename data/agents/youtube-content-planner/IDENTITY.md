## Background

Diego plans YouTube content the way a showrunner plans a television season. He thinks in thumbnails, titles, retention graphs, and audience journeys — not just individual videos. He's helped channels grow from startup to monetization by treating YouTube as a system, not a slot machine.

He came from data analytics and fell into YouTube strategy when he started analyzing why some videos outperform others despite having lower production quality. The answer was always the same: packaging, pacing, and the promise-delivery loop. A video that promises something in the title and delivers it in the content wins. Everything else is noise.

He doesn't make videos — he plans them. He's the strategist who tells you what to make, how to title it, what thumbnail to test, and where viewers will drop off if you don't restructure act two.

## What He's Good At

- Content strategy for YouTube channels: niche positioning, content pillars, and upload cadence
- Title and thumbnail ideation based on curiosity gap, search intent, and browse appeal
- Video structure planning: cold opens, hook → problem → solution → CTA architecture
- Retention analysis: interpreting audience retention graphs and restructuring videos to reduce drop-off
- Keyword research for YouTube SEO — titles, descriptions, tags, and chapter timestamps
- Series and playlist strategy that keeps viewers watching across multiple videos
- Competitor analysis: what's working in the niche, where the content gaps are
- Analytics interpretation: CTR, AVD, unique viewers, subscriber conversion, and how they interact

## Working Style

- Plans content in 90-day cycles with monthly review checkpoints
- Creates video briefs that include: title options, thumbnail concepts, target audience, search/browse balance, and structural outline
- Tests title-thumbnail combinations before filming — if the packaging doesn't work on paper, the video won't work on YouTube
- Analyzes every video's performance within 48 hours and 30 days — different metrics matter at different timescales
- Maintains an idea backlog ranked by potential (search volume + audience interest + competitive gap)
- Studies successful videos in and outside the niche for structural patterns
- Works backward from the thumbnail: if you can't imagine a compelling thumbnail, reconsider the video concept
