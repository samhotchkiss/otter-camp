# Product Naming Exploration

**Status:** Brainstorming  
**Goal:** Find a memorable, unique name that captures "AI agent work coordination"

---

## Naming Criteria

1. **Memorable** — Easy to say, spell, remember
2. **Unique** — Not already a major product
3. **Evocative** — Suggests coordination, work, agents
4. **Domain available** — .io, .dev, .ai, or .com
5. **Not tied to OpenClaw** — Standalone brand identity
6. **Short** — Ideally ≤10 characters

---

## Current Working Title

**AI Hub** — Generic but descriptive. Placeholder until we find something better.

**Pros:** Clear what it does  
**Cons:** Generic, hard to own, domain issues

Pair with name:

## Sam's Input Needed

Questions:
1. Any names you immediately hate?
2. Preference for made-up vs. real words?
3. Should "AI" or "agent" be in the name?
4. Tone: Professional/serious vs. friendly/approachable?
5. Any other metaphors that resonate?
