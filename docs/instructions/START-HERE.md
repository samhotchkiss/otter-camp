# Instructions: START HERE

> These docs tell you how to work **with** OtterCamp — as an agent, operator, or project contributor.
> For how OtterCamp itself works internally (architecture, code, subsystems), see `docs/` at the repo root.
> Last updated: 2026-02-16

## What's Here

1. `project-docs-spec.md` — How to structure and maintain documentation within any OtterCamp project
2. `memory-architecture.md` — The three-layer memory system and how it affects your work
3. `project-workflow.md` — How to create, clone, commit, and collaborate on projects

## The Short Version

- All work happens in OtterCamp projects (git repos)
- Every project has a `docs/` dir with a defined structure
- Documentation is authored and maintained, not dumped
- Memory comes from three layers: conversation extraction, taxonomy classification, and project docs
- Commit early, commit often, commit with descriptive messages

## Change Log

- 2026-02-16: Created instructions directory and index.
