# Notes

## [2026-02-13 09:45 MST] Spec 159 — Ellie Memory Follow-Ups: Semantic Retrieval and LLM Ingestion — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-159-ellie-memory-followups` merged to main via PR #945
- 4 micro-issues (#941-944), all closed. 6 files changed, +889/-37 lines
- Pre-merge gate: go vet ✅, go build ✅, vitest 442/442 ✅
- 10 new tests pass (semantic retrieval, cascade embedding, LLM extraction, fallback paths)
- Security audit: SQL injection safe (parameterized queries, type-safe vectors), org scoping verified at all query layers

## [2026-02-12 19:57 MST] Spec 158 — Conversation Token Tracking — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-158-conversation-token-tracking` merged to main (42a36902)
- All acceptance criteria met: token_count column, total_tokens rollup, DB trigger, backfill worker, room stats API, CLI command
- Pre-merge gate: go vet ✅, go build ✅, go test ✅ (all pass), vitest ✅ (442/442)

- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- PR #940 merged: fix(import) enforce source-guard symlink escape checks (commit 18454ef0)
- Fixes Linux CI regression (TestOpenClawSourceGuardRejectsSymlinkEscape) by always resolving symlinks before root containment check
- Security-positive: closes symlink-escape vector where logical path inside root could point outside via symlink
- Tests: symlink escape rejection ✅, in-root symlink allow ✅, full Go suite (25 packages) ✅, vitest (442/442) ✅
- Pre-merge gate: go vet ✅, go build ✅, go test ✅, vitest ✅

## [2026-02-12 19:25 MST] Spec 155 — Migration from OpenClaw — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-155-migration-from-openclaw-r4` merged to main (fast-forward from 45e9e63..e78a231)
- All pre-merge gate checks pass: `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go test ./... -count=1` (24 packages), `npx vitest run` (94 files, 442 tests)
- 5,823 additions across 31 files, 1 new migration (073 — migration_progress), 17 commits
- Second review cycle: all P0/P1/P2 findings from first review (#912-#917) resolved with regression tests
- Phases implemented: agent import, JSONL parsing, history backfill, Ellie backfill integration, project discovery, CLI, progress API
- Key security controls: symlink traversal guard, SHA256 source snapshot mutation detection, strict UUID validation, RLS org isolation, RequireWorkspace middleware
- Execution log complete with 30+ timestamped entries across issues #895-#920
- No findings on second review — all previous required changes addressed

## [2026-02-12 19:12 MST] Spec 157 — Agent Job Scheduler — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-157-agent-job-scheduler` merged to main
- All pre-merge gate checks pass: `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go test ./... -count=1` (26 packages), `npx vitest run` (94 files, 442 tests)
- 5,658 additions across 25 files, 1 new migration (073), 8 implementation issues (#921-#928)
- All 12 acceptance criteria verified as met
- Execution log complete with timestamped entries for all 8 micro-issues
- Org isolation properly enforced via PostgreSQL RLS (ENABLE + FORCE) on both tables
- No P0 or P1 findings. Four P2 items noted for follow-up:
  1. Worker reuses `now` timestamp for both start/complete → duration_ms always 0 (worker.go:92,149)
  2. `completeFailure` uses potentially expired runCtx for DB writes after timeout (worker.go:161-178)
  3. PATCH handler silently swallows schedule recomputation errors (jobs.go:315-332)
  4. Store `Update` uses non-atomic read-modify-write pattern (agent_job_store.go:388-533)
- Multiple P3 items: down migration convention, test coverage gaps for EnsureRoomForJob/CreateJobMessage/failure escalation, client test missing mutex

## [2026-02-12 18:14 MST] Spec 151 — Ellie Memory Infrastructure — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-151-ellie-memory-infrastructure-r3` merged to main (commit 45e9e63)
- All pre-merge gate checks pass: `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go test ./... -count=1 -short` (25 packages), `npx vitest run` (94 files, 442 tests)
- Branch carries specs 152-154 as sequential dependencies (all already completed); merge lands all four onto main
- 10,276 additions across 66 files, 7 new migrations (066-072)
- Execution log complete with remediation issues #904-#908
- No P0 or P1 findings. Six P2 quality items noted for follow-up (body size limits, error classification, org scoping, type safety, config semantics, missing re-enable endpoint)
- Residual risks: heuristic JSONL extraction (follow-ups #850/#851 open), cross-org worker message listing, RLS dependency on `current_org_id()`

## [2026-02-12 16:45 MST] Spec 154 — Ellie Compliance Review — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-154-ellie-compliance-review` merged to main (commit 8389fa9)
- All pre-merge gate checks pass: `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go test ./...` (24 packages), `npx vitest run` (94 files, 442 tests)
- Test merge with main: clean, no conflicts
- Execution log complete with 13 timestamped entries covering issues #877-#882
- Issue decomposition: 6 micro-issues (#877-#882), well-scoped (schema, store CRUD, evaluator, orchestration, API handlers, memory extraction)
- Branch isolation verified: 6 commits, all spec-154 scoped. No modifications to unrelated specs.
- Security: Org scoping validated at handler + store + RLS levels. Cross-org isolation tested. All queries parameterized.
- No findings (no blockers, no required changes)

### Residual risks (non-blocking, informational)
- No max-length validation on text fields (title, description, check_instruction). Low risk with current internal API usage.
- Compliance evaluator uses heuristic pattern matching, not LLM evaluation. Spec describes future model tiering; current implementation is appropriate for initial delivery.
- DB-dependent tests skip without OTTER_TEST_DATABASE_URL (existing project pattern, not a regression).

## [2026-02-12 16:35 MST] Spec 152 — Ellie Proactive Context Injection — APPROVED (R2 Remediation)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-152-ellie-proactive-context-injection-r2` already merged to main via PR #876 (merge commit fb7f7a1)
- All pre-merge gate checks pass on main: `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...`, `go test ./...` (24 packages), `npx vitest run` (94 files, 442 tests)
- Execution log complete with 18 timestamped entries covering issues #845-#876
- Issue decomposition: 8 micro-issues (#852-#856, #862, #863, #871), well-scoped

### Findings (non-blocking, logged for follow-up)

#### P2 — Supersession notes are effectively dead code in production
- Files: `internal/store/ellie_context_injection_store.go:210-227`, `internal/memory/ellie_context_injection_worker.go:205-214`
- Impact: The `SearchMemoryCandidatesByEmbedding` query filters `WHERE status = 'active'`. The `superseded_by` column on `memories` points from the deprecated memory to its replacement. Active replacement memories have `superseded_by = NULL`. So the worker's `SupersedesMemoryID` mapping is always nil, and supersession notes never fire.
- Unit tests pass because the fake queue manually sets `SupersededBy`, masking the real query behavior. Integration test `TestEllieContextInjectionIncludesSupersessionNote` is skipped without a test database.
- Recommended fix: Add a reverse join or subquery to detect whether an active memory is the replacement for a previously-injected deprecated memory. Alternatively, add a `supersedes` column on the replacement memory.
- Required test: Integration test with real DB verifying supersession note appears when an active memory replaces a previously-deprecated one.

#### P3 — CooldownMessages=0 cannot disable cooldown
- Files: `internal/memory/ellie_context_injection_worker.go:75-81`
- Impact: Config validation allows `CooldownMessages >= 0`, but the worker constructor treats `0` as "unset" and overrides to default (4). Users cannot intentionally disable cooldown.
- Recommended fix: Use a sentinel value (e.g., -1) for "use default", or use a pointer type, or change the check to only apply defaults when the config struct is zero-valued.
- Required test: Unit test verifying `CooldownMessages=0` results in no cooldown enforcement.

## [2026-02-12 15:18 MST] Spec 150 — Conversation Schema Redesign — APPROVED (Re-review)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-150-conversation-schema-redesign` merged to main via PR #827
- 10 commits, 24 files changed (+3565/-10 lines), issues #821-#826 + remediation #838-#841
- Pre-merge gate: all checks passed (go vet ✅, go build ✅, vitest 94 files/442 tests ✅, go test ./... all packages ✅, merge clean ✅)
- Implements: 5 core tables (rooms, room_participants, conversations, chat_messages, memories), RLS on all tables, project chat backfill migration (064), legacy memory backfill migration (065), conversations.sensitivity column (069), dual-write path for project chat, embedding worker with org-fair queue selection, segmentation worker with time-gap splitting, cancellable worker lifecycle with signal/WaitGroup shutdown, full config/env wiring
- Prior review (round 1) flagged 4 items: embedding org fairness, conversations.sensitivity, cancellable lifecycle, segmentation org fairness — all resolved in remediation issues #838-#841
- No P0/P1/P2 findings. P3 observations (non-blocking): (1) embedding store lacks UUID validation on IDs (parameterized so SQL-safe), (2) deriveConversationTopic is simplistic first-80-chars (intentional per spec), (3) legacy embeddings not migrated (self-healing via embedding worker)

## [2026-02-12 12:50 MST] Spec 130 — Onboarding P1 Org Settings Slug Surface — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-130-org-settings-slug` merged to main via PR #769
- Pre-merge gate: all checks passed (go vet ✅, go build ✅, vitest 94 files/442 tests ✅, merge conflict-free ✅)
- Core changes: 4 files (API slug response, UI slug display, backend + frontend tests)
- No findings. Clean, well-scoped implementation with proper test coverage.

## [2026-02-12 12:27 MST] Spec 129 — Onboarding P1 Git Token Creation UI — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-129-onboarding-p1-git-token-ui` merged to main via PR #765
- 15 commits, 14 files changed (+1281/-2312 lines), issues #761-#764 + remediation #773, #776, #792-#797, #800
- Implements: Git Access Tokens section in Settings with token list from `/api/git/tokens`, create flow with project permissions payload via `/api/projects` + `/api/git/tokens`, one-time token reveal banner, revoke via `/api/git/tokens/{id}/revoke`, empty-project and API-failure error messaging
- Also includes: automigrate `dirty` column compatibility fix with tests, comprehensive E2E test rebaseline (auth helper, agents, auth, navigation, search, kanban, tasks, settings, notifications suites)
- All pre-merge gates passed: git merge main (clean), go vet ✅, go build ✅, frontend 94 files/441 tests ✅, automigrate 3 tests ✅, CI Backend/Frontend/E2E all SUCCESS
- P3 findings (non-blocking): (1) generated token banner lacks dismiss button, (2) kanban.spec.ts duplicates tasks.spec.ts — both deferred to follow-up

## [2026-02-12 12:22 MST] Spec 126 — Seed Starter Trio on Fresh Install — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-126-seed-starter-trio` merged to main via PR #816
- 3 commits, 6 files changed (+270/-1 lines), issues #811, #812, #813
- Implements: ensureOnboardingAgents() seeds Frank/Lori/Ellie during bootstrap (idempotent upsert), agents returned in API response, CLI prints "Created agents" confirmation, ottercli client parses agent payload
- All pre-merge gates passed: git merge main (clean), go vet ✅, go build ✅, frontend 94 files/435 tests ✅, go test for api/ottercli/cmd ✅
- No findings. Clean implementation with good test coverage. DB-dependent tests require OTTER_TEST_DATABASE_URL (pre-existing pattern). Also includes a minor test assertion fix aligning Elephant→Ellie wording.

## [2026-02-12 12:20 MST] Spec 125 — Three + Temps: Temp Lifecycle + Project-Scoped Teardown Primitives — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-125-three-plus-temps-architecture` merged to main via PR #808
- 19 files changed, +811/-57 lines across 8 commits (issues #803-#810)
- Implements: DB migration for agent lifecycle metadata (is_ephemeral, project_id), admin API create/list/get with lifecycle fields, project-scoped bulk temp retirement endpoint, CLI create --ephemeral/--project flags, CLI archive --project bulk mode, Elephant→Ellie display name remediation
- All pre-merge gates passed: go vet ✅, go build ✅, frontend 435 tests ✅, CI Backend ✅, CI Frontend ✅
- No findings. Clean, well-tested, correctly workspace-scoped implementation.

## [2026-02-11 11:33 MST] Spec 128 — Onboarding P1 Login UX Local/Hosted Routing — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-128-onboarding-p1-login-ux` merged to main via PR #760
- 3 commits, 2 files changed (275 insertions, 57 deletions)
- Pre-merge gate: go vet (clean), go build (clean), trial merge with main (up to date), npx vitest run (94 files, 435 tests pass)
- All 5 acceptance criteria verified:
  1. Login page defaults to Local mode and shows magic-link form
  2. Switching to Hosted mode shows deferment messaging and link to `https://otter.camp/setup`
  3. Switching back to Local restores magic-link form without regressions
  4. Local submit success and error paths behave correctly (tested with mode toggle)
  5. 6 targeted frontend tests pass covering default render, hosted guidance, copy content, mode-switch submit, success state, and error state
- No findings. Clean, well-scoped implementation with proper ARIA accessibility, isolated branch, and thorough test coverage.
- Linked issues: closes #757, #758, #759; refs #239

## [2026-02-11 10:40 MST] Spec 127 — Onboarding P0 Auth and Magic Link Hardening — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-127-onboarding-p0-auth` merged to main via PR #753
- 7 commits, 8 files changed (596 insertions, 141 deletions)
- Pre-merge gate: go vet (clean), go build (clean), trial merge with main (clean), npx vitest run (93 files, 429 tests pass), targeted backend auth tests (10 pass, 3 skip without DB)
- All 4 acceptance criteria verified:
  1. Backend `requireSessionIdentity` validates `oc_magic_` tokens via strict `isWellFormedSessionToken` allowlist; rejects malformed tokens before DB lookup
  2. Frontend auth bootstrap refactored to API-backed session validation; removed hardcoded token heuristics; invalid sessions clear stored auth state
  3. `HandleMagicLink` accepts custom `organization_name`/`org_name`/`org_slug`/email inputs with validation; `@localhost` emails allowed only for local bootstrap
  4. New sqlmock-based backend tests (no external DB dependency) + updated frontend AuthContext tests cover acceptance, rejection, and edge cases
- Security notes: Pre-existing concerns (unauthenticated magic endpoint, ON CONFLICT upsert overwrites, env-flag auth bypass) documented but not introduced by this spec; this spec adds input validation where none existed before
- Issues: #747, #748, #749, #750, #754, #755, #756 (all closed)

## [2026-02-11 10:35 MST] Spec 126 — Bridge Write Path Guard Hard Enforcement — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-126-bridge-write-path-guard` merged to main via PR #746
- 5 commits, 2 files changed (1,095 insertions, 204 deletions): `bridge/openclaw-bridge.ts`, `bridge/openclaw-bridge.test.ts`
- Pre-merge gate: go vet (clean), go build (clean), trial merge with main (clean), npx vitest run bridge (31 pass), npx tsx --test bridge tests (44 pass + 8 admin), cd web && npx vitest run (93 files, 427 tests pass)
- All 4 acceptance criteria verified:
  1. Mutation tools blocked outside active project root at execution time (traversal + symlink escape rejection)
  2. Mutation tools blocked in conversation mode (no project_id → abort)
  3. Symlink escape attempts rejected (real symlink creation + lstat check)
  4. Bridge tests cover all scenarios and pass (13 new test cases)
- 2 review cycles (original review → reviewer-required changes addressed in c527d67)
- Prior reviewer required changes (#751/#752) all resolved: null-byte sanitization, fail-closed catch/abort, toolCallId propagation, expanded edge-case test coverage
- Execution log: 20+ timestamped entries across 7 GitHub issues (#550, #742-#745, #751-#752)
- Branch isolation confirmed: 5 bridge-only commits, no unrelated spec contamination
- No P0/P1/P2 findings
- Residual observations (non-blocking, tracked separately):
  - TOCTOU between symlink check and write execution is acknowledged in code with `TODO(spec-110-hardening)` — tracked in separate spec
  - Enforcement is reactive (abort-after-detection via `void` dispatch) rather than preventive — pre-existing architectural pattern, not introduced by this spec
  - `abortMutationRun` swallows abort RPC failures with console.warn (no retry) — acceptable for v1 given fail-closed catch wrapper
  - Unified diff regex does not cover `--- a/` source paths or git `rename to`/`copy to` headers — fails closed (zero targets → blocked) but could allow false-positive blocks on valid renames
  - `MUTATION_TOOL_NAMES` set is hardcoded; new mutation tools require manual addition

## [2026-02-10 15:30 MST] Spec 122 — Bridge Escalation on Prolonged Disconnect — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-122-bridge-escalation-prolonged-disconnect` merged to main
- 12 commits, 8 files changed (653 insertions, 92 deletions)
- Files: `bridge/openclaw-bridge.ts`, `bridge/__tests__/openclaw-bridge.connection-state.test.ts`, `bridge/__tests__/openclaw-bridge.health-endpoint.test.ts`, `web/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx`, `web/src/layouts/DashboardLayout.test.tsx`, `web/src/theme.css`, `vitest.config.ts`
- Pre-merge gate: go vet (clean), go build (clean), npx vitest run (30 bridge tests pass), cd web && npx vitest run (86 files, 377 tests pass), trial merge with main clean
- All 5 acceptance criteria verified: self-restart at 60 failures (~5min), per-connection health tracking, alert at 30 failures (~3min), restart reason logging, dashboard degraded state
- 4 review cycles total (original + 3 reviewer-required-change rounds); all prior findings resolved
- Execution log: 50+ timestamped entries across 20+ GitHub issues (#695-#714)
- No P0/P1/P2 findings
- P3 residual observations (non-blocking):
  - `scripts/setup.sh` change in branch scope was unrelated but resolved by merge (not included in final diff)
  - Console.warn at warning threshold (5 failures) lacks explicit unit test for call count
  - Frontend `formatLastSyncLabel` has unreachable defensive null/negative check (harmless)

## [2026-02-10 14:08 MST] Spec 111 — Memory Infrastructure Overhaul — APPROVED (R4, final review)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-111-memory-infrastructure-overhaul-r4` merged to main via PR #691
- Pre-merge gate: go vet (clean), go build (clean), go test ./... (all pass), npx vitest run (86 files, 377 tests pass), trial merge with origin/main clean
- CI: Backend Tests ✅, Frontend Tests ✅
- All 12 prior reviewer-required changes (4×P1, 5×P2, 3×P3) verified fixed with test coverage
- Branch isolation confirmed: 42 spec-111 commits on first-parent line, no unrelated spec contamination
- Execution log: 100+ timestamped entries across 4 review cycles, 16+ GitHub issues tracked
- Residual observations (non-blocking, P3):
  - Recall handler maxResults/maxChars not capped at handler level (store defaults protect, but no hard cap)
  - Missing dedicated tests for: oversized memory Create body, oversized error-path responses, hard relevance floor (0.60)
  - These are defense-in-depth and test coverage polish items, not production risks

## [2026-02-10 12:29 MST] Spec 121 — Onboarding: Add New Agents to OpenClaw Config — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6
- Branch `codex/spec-121-onboarding-openclaw-agents-r2-clean` merged to main via PR #693
- 1 commit, 4 files changed (592 insertions, 47 deletions)
- Files: `cmd/otter/init.go`, `cmd/otter/init_test.go`, `internal/import/openclaw.go`, `internal/import/openclaw_test.go`
- Pre-merge gate: go vet (clean), go build (clean), go test ./... (all pass), npx vitest run (86 files, 375 tests pass)
- Implementation: EnsureOpenClawRequiredAgents adds Memory Agent and Chameleon slots to openclaw.json with idempotency; creates memory-agent workspace with SOUL.md and state file; wired into init flow as non-fatal step with WARNING on error
- Security: symlink protection on workspace dir creation and file writes (Lstat + O_EXCL); init flow continues on ensure failure
- Non-blocking observations: P2 test coverage gaps on alternate type-switch branches; P3 non-atomic config write; P3 mutable package-level map template
- Issues: #643, #644, #665, #666 (all closed)

## [2026-02-10 12:25 MST] Spec 111 — Memory Infrastructure Overhaul — APPROVED (R4)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6
- Branch `codex/spec-111-memory-infrastructure-overhaul-r4` merged to main
- 42 commits, 66+ files changed across Go backend, bridge, CLI, frontend
- 4 review cycles addressing 12 original findings (P1-P3), all verified fixed in R4
- Pre-merge gate: go vet (clean), go build (clean), go test ./... (all pass), npx vitest run (86 files, 377 tests pass)
- Migration 058: pgvector extension, memory_entries, memory_entry_embeddings (IVFFlat), shared_knowledge, shared_knowledge_embeddings, agent_memory_config, compaction_events, agent_teams, working_memory, memory_events tables with RLS + indexes
- Backend: MemoryStore (CRUD/search/recall/delete/UpdateStatus), SharedKnowledgeStore, WorkingMemoryStore, MemoryEventsStore, embedder pipeline (Ollama/OpenAI), evaluator harness, bounded tuner with rollback
- API: /memory/entries, /memory/search, /memory/recall, /memory/events, /knowledge, /knowledge/import, /memory/eval endpoints with RequireWorkspace, MaxBytesReader, limit capping, org isolation
- CLI: otter memory write/list/search/recall/delete, otter knowledge list/import/share with validation
- Bridge: compaction detection + recovery injection (fail-closed), auto recall injection with quality gates
- Frontend: AgentMemoryBrowser, KnowledgePage, MemoryEvaluationPage with routing
- Merge conflict: trivial additive in client_test.go resolved by keeping both test functions
- Residual risks (non-blocking): OptionalWorkspace on /memory/events, negative max_chars bypass, knowledge validation errors as 500, IVFFlat on empty tables, truncateRecallText byte/rune semantics

## [2026-02-09 22:35 MST] Spec 110 — Chameleon Agent Architecture — APPROVED (R8)

- Pre-merge gate: go vet (clean), go build (clean), go test -race ./internal/api/... (pass), npm run test:bridge (23/23), vitest (85 files, 369 tests pass)
- Migrations 053-057: agent identity columns, agent_memories table with RLS + FK + daily unique index, activity completion metadata, org-scoped agent_sync_state
- Backend: whoami compact/full endpoint, memory CRUD+search, workspace import, config cutover/rollback with release gate
- Bridge: identity preamble injection, execution mode resolver, path guard (policy-level v1), atomic config writes, session key validation, WS secret redaction
- CLI: otter agent whoami/list/create/edit/archive, otter memory write/read/search, release-gate command
- Frontend: AgentIdentityEditor (apiFetch, AbortController, state-driven save), AgentMemoryBrowser (unmount cancellation), AddAgentModal (authenticated), chameleon routing copy
- Known v1 limitations tracked in issue #550: policy-level write enforcement only, path guard not mechanically wired, TOCTOU gaps in symlink check
- Residual risks (non-blocking, P2-P3): identity injection TOCTOU race on concurrent first messages, config.cutover missing hash validation, daily memory insert not upsert-safe
- All pre-existing issues (CORS wildcard, static path concat, GetAgents auth, WithWorkspace SET LOCAL) are not introduced by this spec

## [2026-02-09 20:35 MST] Spec 117 — Workflows as Projects — APPROVED (R2)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6
- Branch `codex/spec-117-workflows-as-projects-r2` merged to main via PR #578
- 27 files changed, 4326 insertions, 529 deletions
- Migration 049: workflow columns (enabled, schedule, template, agent, run tracking) added to projects table with partial index and ON DELETE SET NULL FK
- Store layer: full workflow field persistence in Create/Update/Scan with JSON normalization and agent UUID validation
- API: extended projects PATCH/GET/List with workflow fields, schedule validation (cron/every/at with kind-specific checks), atomic run count increment, template variable rendering, runs endpoints (list/latest/trigger)
- Legacy `/api/workflows` endpoints backed by project store with compatibility adapters (list/toggle/run)
- Bridge: cron→project sync with auto-create, cron_id matching, name fallback (restricted to workflow projects), concurrency guard, deduplication by cron_id+last_run_at, first-sync guard
- Frontend: WorkflowsPage rewritten to use `/api/projects?workflow=true`, WorkflowConfig component for schedule/template/agent editing, ProjectDetailPage integration with partial-save recovery
- CLI: `project list --workflow`, `project run`, `project runs`, `project create --workflow` with schedule/template/agent flags
- Pre-merge gate: go vet ✅, go build ✅, vitest 364/364 ✅, bridge 15/15 ✅
- Security: org-scoped queries throughout, cross-org agent validation, auth required on all endpoints, simple string template rendering (no injection risk)
- No P0/P1/P2 findings. P3 only: dead code in legacy list status branch, missing DisallowUnknownFields on Create

## [2026-02-09 19:10 MST] Spec 116 — Local Install Blockers — APPROVED (R2)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6
- Branch `codex/spec-116-local-install-blockers-r2` merged to main
- 51 files changed, 813 insertions, 129 deletions across setup scripts, auth, API_URL centralization, docker-compose, WS handler, README
- New files: scripts/setup.sh (bootstrap), scripts/seed/seed.go (DB seeder + tests), bridge/.env.example
- Fix 1 (setup bootstrap): make setup creates .env, starts postgres, runs migrations, seeds workspace, writes CLI config
- Fix 2 (local auth): AuthHandler.tsx handles ?auth= URL param, dual-key localStorage (otter_camp_token + legacy), shouldBypassDBTokenValidation extracted
- Fix 3 (API_URL centralization): 30+ independent `const API_URL = ... || 'https://api.otter.camp'` declarations replaced with single export from lib/api.ts; fallback changed to window.location.origin
- Fix 4 (Redis removal): Redis service and redis_data volume removed from docker-compose.yml
- Fix 5 (git repo path): defaultGitRepoRoot changed from /data/repos to ./data/repos
- Fix 6 (bridge env template): bridge/.env.example added
- Fix 7 (WebSocket origins): APP_ENV-based dev mode allows all origins; production requires explicit allowlist
- Fix 8 (prod-local): make prod-local target added for single-port mode
- Fix 9 (README): Quick Start rewritten for local-first flow
- Pre-merge gate: merge clean (rebased), go vet clean, go build clean, 348/348 vitest pass (83 files)
- Go tests: ws, store, seed packages all pass
- Pre-existing test failures on main (TestRouterFeedEndpointUsesV2Handler, TestProjectsAndInboxRoutesAreRegistered) confirmed unrelated
- Residual non-blocking notes (P3, logged for future improvement):
  - CLI defaultAPIBaseURL in internal/ottercli/config.go still set to https://api.otter.camp (spec says change to localhost:8080); mitigated by setup.sh writing CLI config file
  - Stale JSDoc comment in web/src/lib/api.ts line 3 still says "api.otter.camp"
  - AgentsPage.test.tsx lines 96/130/177 still use hardcoded https://api.otter.camp in test props
  - data/ and data/repos not in .gitignore (setup.sh creates these locally)
  - setup.sh secret fallback (line 26) uses date-based hash when openssl unavailable; weak on macOS where %N is unsupported
  - setup.sh writes CLI config file with default permissions (should chmod 600)
  - .env.example does not include LOCAL_AUTH_TOKEN (already present via setup.sh generation)

## [2026-02-09 18:00 MST] Spec 108 — Pipeline Settings UI & CLI — APPROVED (R3)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6
- Branch `codex/spec-108-pipeline-settings-ui-cli-r3` merged to main (4dfb47a)
- 37 files changed, 4585 insertions, 128 deletions across migrations, store, API, CLI, and frontend
- 3 migrations (050-052): deploy config table, require_human_review column, reviewer gate approval state
- Full store CRUD for deploy config and pipeline roles with org isolation (RLS + workspace checks)
- API handlers for GET/PUT pipeline-roles, GET/PUT deploy-config, PATCH projects (requireHumanReview)
- Two-stage approval gate: reviewer → human approval when require_human_review is enabled
- CLI: `otter pipeline` and `otter deploy` command groups with JSON output support
- Frontend: PipelineSettings, DeploySettings components with ProjectSettingsPage layout
- Pre-merge gate: merge clean, go vet clean, go build clean, 343/343 vitest pass (81 files)
- All spec-108 Go tests pass (10 pass, 13 skip without test DB)
- Pre-existing test failures on main (TestRouterFeedEndpointUsesV2Handler, TestProjectsAndInboxRoutesAreRegistered) confirmed unrelated
- Residual non-blocking notes (P2-P3, logged for future improvement):
  - ErrValidation error messages return "internal server error" with 400 status (contradictory but safe)
  - github_push deploy method does not require github_repo_url (asymmetric with cli_command validation)
  - Frontend success banners not cleared on projectId change
  - CLI printJSONTo silently swallows marshal errors
  - CLI set-role uses read-modify-write pattern (TOCTOU race, low-risk for CLI)
- Execution log: 10 phases, 30+ micro-issues, 3 review rounds — all resolved

## [2026-02-09 16:55 MST] Spec 018 — Dark Theme Settings Page — APPROVED (final re-validation)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4 (session review)
- Branch `codex/spec-018-dark-theme-settings-page` (3 commits: 1e1757a, 680a534, d7d48e3)
- Already merged to main via merge commits 8877e98 and 826e0db; PR #452 was closed unmerged (code merged directly)
- Full code diff review of SettingsPage.tsx (94 insertions/98 deletions) and GitHubSettings.tsx (102 insertions/102 deletions)
- All hardcoded slate/white Tailwind classes replaced with CSS custom property tokens: --surface, --surface-alt, --border, --text, --text-muted, --accent
- Test files added: SettingsPage.test.tsx (3 tests including theme token class assertions), GitHubSettings.test.tsx (9 tests including shell/control class assertions)
- Pre-merge gate: go vet clean, go build clean, 327/327 vitest pass (78 files), 12 targeted tests pass
- No blocking findings. No findings at all.
- Residual risks:
  - P3: emerald-500/emerald-100 hardcoded for owner/admin role badges and selected theme option (uses dark: prefix, not CSS vars) — acceptable since these are semantic status colors
  - P3: Error text in LabelManagementSection uses hardcoded `text-red-700` without dark mode variant — minor, error states are transient
  - P3: Error banner in GitHubSettings uses hardcoded red-200/red-50 with dark: overrides instead of CSS vars — acceptable, consistent pattern
- Moved to 05-completed

## [2026-02-09 16:48 MST] Spec 019 — Visual Review Flowchart — APPROVED (re-validated)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4 (session review)
- Branch `codex/spec-019-visual-review-flowchart` (3 commits: 0096fe0, f8d5d6e, 2128619)
- Already merged to main via df2a094; PR #456 was closed unmerged (code merged directly)
- Full code review of all 12 changed files (811 insertions)
- Components: IssuePipelineFlow, PipelineStageNode, PipelineMiniProgress, pipelineStages.ts
- Integration: IssueThreadPanel (PATCH transitions + skip-confirmation), ProjectIssuesList (mini progress), ProjectDetailPage (board/list cards)
- Pre-merge gate: go vet clean, go build clean, 327/327 vitest pass (78 files), 37 targeted tests pass
- No blocking findings. Residual risks documented:
  - P3: Planning stage click maps to "queued" (no distinct backend status); minor UX confusion possible
  - P3: 200-item hardcoded limit on issue lists with no truncation indicator
  - P3: Multi-stage transition partial failure leaves issue in intermediate state (error shown, no rollback)
  - P3: No dedicated PipelineStageNode test file (covered indirectly)
- Moved to 05-completed

## [2026-02-09 16:42 MST] Spec 018 — Dark Theme Settings Page — APPROVED (confirmed)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4 (re-review)
- Branch `codex/spec-018-dark-theme-settings-page` (3 commits: 1e1757a, 680a534, d7d48e3)
- Already merged to main (8877e98, 826e0db); PR #452 closed as administrative artifact
- All hardcoded light-theme classes (bg-white, text-gray-*, border-gray-*, bg-gray-50) replaced with CSS custom properties (--surface, --border, --text, --text-muted, --surface-alt, --accent)
- Semantic accent colors (emerald/blue/red/amber) retain dark: variants — correct pattern
- 12/12 targeted tests pass (SettingsPage.test.tsx: 3, GitHubSettings.test.tsx: 9)
- go build clean; go vet has pre-existing unrelated failures; broad vitest has pre-existing unrelated failures
- P3 finding: SettingsPage.tsx:763 label error uses text-red-700 without dark: variant (minor polish)
- Moved to 05-completed

## [2026-02-09 15:59 MST] Spec 019 — Visual Review Flowchart — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4
- Branch `codex/spec-019-visual-review-flowchart` (3 commits: 0096fe0, f8d5d6e, 2128619)
- Code already merged to main via commit df2a094; PR #456 closed as administrative artifact
- Implementation: IssuePipelineFlow, PipelineStageNode, PipelineMiniProgress components with canonical stage mapping (pipelineStages.ts)
- Integration: IssueThreadPanel (interactive PATCH transitions with skip-confirmation), ProjectIssuesList (mini progress in rows), ProjectDetailPage (mini progress in board/list cards)
- Blocked/flagged status handled as detour badge on in_progress stage
- Tests: 37 targeted tests pass (5 test files), 324/324 full suite pass (78 files)
- Pre-merge gate: go vet clean, go build clean, vitest all pass
- No findings. Residual note: planning stage normalizes to queued in transitions (no distinct API status); transition animation is progress-bar based rather than sliding dot
- Moved to 05-completed

## [2026-02-09 15:55 MST] Spec 018 — Dark Theme Settings Page — APPROVED (final review)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4
- Independent re-review of all 3 diffs (1e1757a, 680a534, d7d48e3)
- Code is already merged to main (merge commits 826e0db, 8877e98); branch and main are identical
- Tokenization of hardcoded slate/white Tailwind classes to CSS custom properties is complete and correct
- Residual hardcoded `dark:` classes are semantic status colors (emerald/amber/blue/red) — not in scope, not blocking
- Pre-existing theme toggle mechanism mismatch (classList vs data-theme attr) not introduced by this spec
- Tests: SettingsPage.test.tsx 3/3 pass, GitHubSettings.test.tsx 9/9 pass
- Moved to 05-completed

## [2026-02-09 15:50 MST] Spec 018 — Dark Theme Settings Page — CONFIRMED APPROVED (3rd review pass)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus
- Spec re-entered 03-needs-review queue after state reconciliation (PR #452 closed unmerged, but code was already merged to main via direct merge commits 826e0db and 8877e98)
- Full re-review confirms: all 3 branch commits (1e1757a, 680a534, d7d48e3) are on main via `git branch --merged main`
- CSS tokenization verified: zero hardcoded `bg-white`, `bg-slate-*`, `text-slate-*`, `border-slate-*` classes remain in SettingsPage.tsx or GitHubSettings.tsx
- CSS custom properties (`--surface`, `--border`, `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--surface-alt`, `--accent`) properly defined in `web/src/theme.css` with dark/light mode values
- Targeted tests: SettingsPage.test.tsx (3/3 pass), GitHubSettings.test.tsx (9/9 pass)
- Pre-existing failures in unrelated files (ConnectionsPage, AgentDetailPage, projectTaskSummary, bridge admin) — not introduced by spec-018
- Go vet failures in backend test files (ottercli, store, api) — pre-existing, unrelated to frontend CSS changes
- Residual P3: `text-red-700` error text on line 763 SettingsPage.tsx lacks dark variant (non-blocking — contrast acceptable)
- No new findings. Spec moved to 05-completed.

## [2026-02-09 15:46 MST] Spec 019 — Visual Review Flowchart — APPROVED (already merged)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus
- Branch: `codex/spec-019-visual-review-flowchart` (3 commits: 0096fe0, f8d5d6e, 2128619)
- Issues: #453, #454, #455 — all closed; PR #456
- Branch was pre-merged to main at df2a094 before this review session
- Pre-merge gate: `go vet`, `go build`, `npx vitest run` all pass on main (324 tests, 78 files, 0 failures)
- Branch isolation: confirmed clean — 3 commits touching only 12 pipeline/issue UI files
- Created files: `IssuePipelineFlow.tsx`, `PipelineStageNode.tsx`, `PipelineMiniProgress.tsx`, `pipelineStages.ts`
- Modified files: `IssueThreadPanel.tsx`, `ProjectIssuesList.tsx`, `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` (+ 5 test files)
- Spec requirements met: visual pipeline stages, blocked detour badge, interactive transitions with skip confirmation, mini progress on list/board views, CSS custom property theming, responsive stacking
- Test coverage: 37 targeted tests across 5 files covering stage mapping, blocked state, click transitions, skip confirmation, optimistic comments, approval workflow, mini progress rendering
- No findings (functional, security, or regression)
- Residual risks: `stageUpdatedAt` relies on `last_activity_at` (not a dedicated stage-transition timestamp) — time-in-stage display is approximate; acceptable for current use
- Spec moved to 05-completed

## [2026-02-09 15:40 MST] Spec 018 — Dark Theme Settings Page — RE-APPROVED (PR closed)
- Reviewer: Claude Opus
- Re-review triggered by state reconciliation: spec was moved back to 03-needs-review because PR #452 was still open

- Pre-merge gate re-run after test merge: `go vet`, `go build`, `npx vitest run` all passed (324 tests, 78 files, 0 failures)
- Code audit: zero hardcoded light-theme classes remain; all CSS custom property tokens verified against `web/src/theme.css`
- Minor residual: SettingsPage.tsx:763 `text-red-700` error text lacks `dark:` variant (P3, non-blocking — red-700 has acceptable contrast on dark surfaces)
- Spec moved to 05-completed

## [2026-02-09 14:56 MST] Spec 018 — Dark Theme Settings Page — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus

- Reviewer: Claude Opus
- Branch: `codex/spec-008-live-activity-emissions-routes` (0 commits beyond main — verification only)
- Issue: #499 — closed with test evidence
- No merge needed: branch identical to main; original spec-008 implementation already merged at `e244185`
- Verification confirmed all 3 required routes wired in `router.go`: `GET /activity/recent`, `POST /activity/ingest`, `GET /agents/{id}/activity`
- `TestAgentActivityRoutesRegistered` exists in `agent_activity_test.go` (+ 6 other activity test functions)
- No code changes, no security concerns, no regressions. No findings.

## [2026-02-09 14:50 MST] Spec 019 — Visual Review Flowchart — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus
- Branch: `codex/spec-019-visual-review-flowchart` (3 commits)

## [2026-02-09 13:35 MST] Spec 018 — Dark Theme Settings Page — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus
- Branch: `codex/spec-018-dark-theme-settings-page` (3 commits, rebased onto main)
- Issues: #449, #450, #451 — all closed; PR #452
- Merged to `main` via `--no-ff`
- All 12 targeted tests pass (SettingsPage: 3, GitHubSettings: 9); 5 pre-existing unrelated failures confirmed on branch base
- Changes: Replaced all hardcoded Tailwind slate/white light-first classes with CSS custom property references (`var(--surface)`, `var(--text)`, `var(--text-muted)`, `var(--border)`, `var(--surface-alt)`, `var(--accent)`) in SettingsPage.tsx and GitHubSettings.tsx
- All CSS variables verified in `web/src/theme.css` with dark (`:root`) and light (`[data-theme="light"]`) values
- Zero remaining hardcoded slate/white classes in either file
- P3 note: Semantic status colors (red/amber/emerald/blue for error/warning/success/info) still use `dark:` variant pattern — could be tokenized in a future theming pass
- No security, regression, or functional concerns

## [2026-02-09 13:25 MST] Spec 017 — Feed Actor Names Show "System" for Git Pushes — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus
- Branch: `codex/spec-017-feed-actor-names` (3 commits)
- Issues: #445, #446, #447 — all closed; PR #448
- Merged to `main` via `--no-ff`
- All 12 targeted frontend tests pass; backend Go tests blocked by pre-existing `settings_test.go` compile errors (confirmed same on main)
- P3 notes:
  - Actor resolution logic (`metadataActorCandidate` + candidate chain) duplicated across Dashboard.tsx, activity/ActivityPanel.tsx, and legacy ActivityPanel.tsx — recommend extracting to shared utility; legacy panel uses `??` chain (no trim, no "unknown" filter) which is inconsistent
  - No server-side or CSS truncation on actor names from webhook payloads (low risk, GitHub limits usernames)
- No security, regression, or functional concerns

## [2026-02-09 13:20 MST] Spec 016 — Chat Agent Name Resolution — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus
- Branch: `codex/spec-016-chat-agent-name-resolution` (4 commits)
- Issues: #440, #441, #442, #443 — all closed
- Merged to `main` via fast-forward
- All 15 targeted tests pass; TypeScript typecheck clean; 5 pre-existing unrelated test failures confirmed
- P3 note: `buildAgentLookupCandidates`/`lookupAgentName` logic duplicated between GlobalChatContext.tsx and MessageHistory.tsx — recommend extracting to shared utility in a future cleanup pass
- No security, regression, or functional concerns

## [2026-02-07 15:32:25 MST] CLI `--mine` identity model
- `otter issue list --mine` currently requires `OTTER_AGENT_ID` to be set in the environment.
- Reason: auth token identity (`/api/auth/validate`) does not currently expose a deterministic mapping to an agent row.
- Recommendation:
  1. Add server-side endpoint that returns "current agent id" for the authenticated token in workspace context, or
  2. Extend auth/session payload to include agent identity where applicable.
- Once that exists, CLI can resolve `--mine` automatically without env var setup.


## [2026-02-07 16:12:10 MST] Spec 103 implementation status
- `103-agent-management.md` currently contains a blocking banner: **"NOT READY FOR WORK"**.
- I am intentionally not implementing Spec 103 yet to follow the spec guardrail.
- Action needed from Sam: remove the banner (or add an explicit go-ahead note in the spec) when ready for implementation.

## [2026-02-07 16:32:20 MST] Bridge command actions validation note
- I added bridge-side handling for `admin.command` actions (`gateway.restart`, `agent.ping`, `agent.reset`).
- Backend tests cover API dispatch + queue fallback, but there is currently no automated TypeScript/unit harness for `bridge/openclaw-bridge.ts` in this repo.
- Recommended manual validation once online:
  1. Start bridge in continuous mode.
  2. Call `POST /api/admin/gateway/restart` with `org_id`.
  3. Confirm bridge logs command receipt/execution and queue acks.

## [2026-02-07 16:59:07 MST] Spec102 Phase3 bridge test harness note
- `bridge/openclaw-bridge.ts` now includes cron/process admin command handling and snapshot collection attempts.
- Repo still has no dedicated TypeScript/unit harness for `bridge/`; bridge behavior is validated via API dispatch tests + manual runtime validation.
- Action commands intentionally use fallback CLI patterns to tolerate OpenClaw CLI variant drift:
  - cron run: `cron run --id` then `cron trigger --id`
  - cron toggle: `cron enable/disable --id` then `cron update --id --enabled ...`
  - process kill: `process kill --id` then `exec kill --id`

## [2026-02-08 10:00:00 MST] Spec105 queue blocker
- `issues/01-ready/105-issue-lifecycle-and-agent-roles.md` still has a top banner: **NOT READY FOR WORK**.
- Following execution policy, implementation is skipped until that banner is removed.
- Continued with next actionable ready spec: `106-questionnaire-primitive.md`.

## [2026-02-08 10:30:19 MST] Spec106 Phase5 bridge questionnaire fallback validation
- Added bridge fallback logic in `bridge/openclaw-bridge.ts` for optional `data.questionnaire` payloads on:
  - `project.chat.message`
  - `issue.comment.message`
- Behavior:
  1. If questionnaire payload is present, bridge appends a formatted `[QUESTIONNAIRE]` block to outbound message text.
  2. Bridge tracks pending questionnaire context for that session.
  3. On assistant final reply, bridge attempts numbered-answer parsing (`1. ...`, `2) ...`).
  4. If parse confidence is high, bridge submits structured responses to `POST /api/questionnaires/{id}/response` with `responded_by` and `responses`.
  5. If parse confidence is low, raw content path is preserved (existing persist behavior continues).
- Manual runtime validation steps:
  1. Start bridge in continuous mode with valid `OTTERCAMP_URL`, `OTTERCAMP_TOKEN`, and OpenClaw credentials.
  2. Dispatch a project or issue event containing `data.questionnaire` and verify OpenClaw-side message includes `[QUESTIONNAIRE]` formatted prompt.
  3. Reply with numbered answers (e.g. `1. WebSocket\n2. 1.5`) and verify bridge log indicates structured questionnaire response capture.
  4. Confirm questionnaire row in OtterCamp shows `responses`, `responded_by`, and `responded_at` populated.
  5. Send ambiguous free-form reply and verify bridge preserves raw message/comment persistence path.

## [2026-02-08 10:31:30 MST] Queue status after Spec106 completion
- `issues/02-in-progress` is clear.
- Remaining `issues/01-ready` item is `105-issue-lifecycle-and-agent-roles.md`, which still includes the top-level **NOT READY FOR WORK** banner.
- No additional actionable ready/in-progress specs remain until Spec105 is unblocked.


## [2026-02-08 10:36:24 MST] Execution blocker status (current run)
- Re-ran preflight and queue selection.
- `105-issue-lifecycle-and-agent-roles.md` remains blocked by the top-level **NOT READY FOR WORK** banner in `issues/01-ready`.
- There are no other actionable specs in `issues/01-ready` or `issues/02-in-progress`.
- Next action required from operator: remove the banner or add a different ready/in-progress spec.

## [2026-02-08 10:45 PST] Spec106 Review -- CHANGES REQUIRED
- Reviewed branch `codex/spec-106-questionnaire-primitive` (5 commits, 24 files, +3348/-33 lines).
- All Go tests pass (`internal/store`, `internal/api`, `internal/ottercli`, `cmd/otter`).
- All 4 questionnaire-specific web tests pass. One pre-existing flaky test (`DashboardLayout.test.tsx`) fails on main too.
- `go vet` failure in `internal/ws` is pre-existing on main, not introduced by this branch.
- Branch isolation confirmed: all changes are spec-106 scoped, no unrelated commits.
- **Disposition: CHANGES REQUIRED** -- 1 P0, 5 P1, 6 P2 findings.
- Key blockers: integer overflow in CLI parser (`parsePositiveInt`), missing explicit `org_id` in store SQL queries, no API-level validation for author/responded_by, no bridge test coverage, spec/impl divergence on CLI syntax and context_type values.
- Spec moved from `04-in-review` to `01-ready` with required-changes block prepended.
- Branch NOT merged to main.

## [2026-02-08 10:57:04 MST] Queue status after Spec106 reviewer fixes
- Spec106 reviewer-required changes are implemented and re-queued in `03-needs-review`.
- `issues/02-in-progress` is now empty.
- Remaining `issues/01-ready` spec is `105-issue-lifecycle-and-agent-roles.md`, still blocked by the top-level **NOT READY FOR WORK** banner.

## [2026-02-08 11:00 PST] Spec106 Re-review -- APPROVED
- Re-reviewed branch `codex/spec-106-questionnaire-primitive` (11 commits, 29 files, +4509/-51 lines).
- All 16 prior findings (1 P0, 5 P1, 6 P2, 4 P3-informational) verified as resolved with evidence.
- All Go tests pass (CLI: 11/11, ottercli: 8/8, API error redaction: 1/1, DB-dependent tests compile correctly but skip without test DB URL).
- All frontend tests pass: 197/198 (1 pre-existing `DashboardLayout` failure unrelated to spec 106).
- All bridge tests pass: 5/5.
- Go build and TypeScript type check both pass cleanly.
- Security audit: org isolation (RLS + app-level), input validation, error redaction, SQL parameterization, transaction safety, double-submit protection all verified.
- **Disposition: APPROVED** -- no new findings.
- Branch merged to `codex/worker-review` (main). Spec moved to `05-completed`.

## [2026-02-08 11:55 MST] Spec105 Review -- APPROVED
- Reviewed branch `codex/spec-105-issue-lifecycle-roles` (11 commits, 19 files, +3707/-137 lines).
- All Go tests pass (`internal/store`, `internal/api`, `internal/ottercli`, `cmd/otter`).
- All 13 web tests pass (ProjectIssuesList: 5, IssueThreadPanel: 8). Full web suite: 191/192 (1 pre-existing `DashboardLayout.test.tsx` failure unrelated).
- TypeScript type check passes cleanly.
- Branch isolation confirmed: all 11 commits scoped to spec 105, no unrelated work.
- All 11 GitHub issues (#306-#316) confirmed CLOSED with execution log entries.
- Implementation covers Phase 1 (parent/child + lifecycle statuses), Phase 2 (role queues, claim/release, role assignments, bridge notifications), Phase 3 (planner batch creation), Phase 4 (worker auto-pickup, branch tracking), Phase 5 (reviewer decision workflow).
- Security audit verified: org isolation (RLS on `issue_role_assignments`), UUID validation, branch/SHA input sanitization, cross-project parent prevention, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` race safety, `DisallowUnknownFields()` on all JSON decoders, FK integrity with `ON DELETE SET NULL`.
- **Disposition: APPROVED** -- no findings.
- Branch merged (fast-forward) to main. Spec moved to `05-completed`.

## [2026-02-08 15:24 MST] Frontend typecheck follow-up
- `cd web && npm run build:typecheck` currently fails on `src/pages/SettingsPage.test.tsx` with TS6133 (`stubFetchForThemeTests` is declared but never used).
- This surfaced during Spec011 reconciliation and appears unrelated to new implementation in this run.

## [2026-02-08 15:43 MST] Spec103 execution blocker (scope + product decisions)
- `103-agent-management.md` is currently a broad multi-phase program spec (repo migration, bridge config patching, agent lifecycle UI, file editing/history, memory browser, rollback workflows) without concrete shippable acceptance slices.
- Blocking product decisions before safe implementation:
  1. Memory strategy selection is unresolved (`Option A` full memory in Otter Camp vs `Option B` local-only daily memory files).
  2. Initial deliverable scope is ambiguous (read-only roster/detail vs full write-capable config + restart + retire/reactivate flows).
  3. Operational/safety constraints for remote `openclaw.json` mutation and gateway restart need explicit approval/guardrails.
- Requested follow-up: provide a Phase-1 constrained scope with explicit acceptance criteria/tests so micro-issue planning can proceed deterministically.

## [2026-02-08 19:01 MST] Queue status after preflight
- Ran full preflight from `issues/instructions.md`.
- `02-in-progress` is empty and `01-ready` has no `.md` specs, so there is no actionable implementation item to execute.
- No new blocker was discovered; work can resume when a spec is moved into `01-ready` or `02-in-progress`.
- [2026-02-08 19:21 MST] Execution blocked by empty actionable queue: `02-in-progress` has no specs and `01-ready` has no spec files. Follow-up required: move a spec into `01-ready` or `02-in-progress` to resume implementation.
- [2026-02-08 19:25 MST] Execution blocked by empty actionable queue: `02-in-progress` has no spec files and `01-ready` has no spec files. Follow-up required: move a spec into `01-ready` or `02-in-progress` to resume implementation.

Follow-up required: move a spec into 01-ready or 02-in-progress to resume implementation.

- [2026-02-08 20:01 MST] Reconciliation follow-up: GitHub issues #415-#419 (spec-008 emission follow-ups) are open but not currently represented by any spec in `01-ready`/`02-in-progress`. If these should be executed now, move the corresponding spec back to `01-ready` with a reviewer-required block that references these issues.

## [2026-02-08 20:37 MST] Post-Spec008 baseline suite follow-up
- During Spec008 reviewer-fix completion, full-suite commands surfaced failures outside emission diff scope:
  - `go test ./...` fails in unchanged main-parity areas (`internal/ottercli`, `internal/store`, and existing `internal/api` route-registration assertions).
  - `cd web && npm run build:typecheck` fails in unchanged main-parity files (`src/components/agents/AddAgentModal.test.tsx`, `src/pages/AgentDetailPage.test.tsx`, `src/components/chat/GlobalChatDock.tsx` prop typing mismatch).
- No code under these paths was modified by `origin/main..codex/spec-008-live-activity-emissions-fixes-v2`; track as baseline stabilization follow-up outside Spec008.

## [2026-02-08 22:42:16 MST] Spec017 backend test-run blocker (`internal/api` compile failure)
- Targeted Spec017 Go test commands are currently blocked before execution by package-level compile errors in `internal/api/settings_test.go`:
  - `undefined: settingsProfileResponse`
  - `undefined: settingsWorkspaceResponse`
  - `undefined: settingsWorkspaceMemberResponse`
  - `undefined: settingsIntegrationsResponse`
- This prevents any `go test ./internal/api -run ...` verification from running, including Spec017 webhook/feed tests.
- `go build ./internal/api` succeeds; blocker is isolated to test compile-time type-name mismatch in settings tests.
- [2026-02-08 23:45 MST] Execution blocked by empty actionable queue after full preflight: `/Users/sam/Documents/Dev/otter-camp/issues/02-in-progress` and `/Users/sam/Documents/Dev/otter-camp/issues/01-ready` contain no spec `.md` files. Reconciliation check: review-state specs `016/017/018/019/108/109` each have open PRs (`#444`, `#448`, `#452`, `#456`, `#439`, `#464`) and closed implementation issues, so no local/GitHub mismatch requiring implementation. Follow-up required: move a spec into `01-ready` or `02-in-progress` (or add reviewer-required changes in `01-ready`) to resume coding.

Required follow-up: run `git push --force-with-lease -u origin codex/spec-121-onboarding-openclaw-agents-r2` from an environment that permits push, then close #665/#666/#664 with commit hashes and move `121-onboarding-add-new-agents-to-openclaw.md` from `02-in-progress` to `03-needs-review`.

- [2026-02-10 12:11 MST] Blocker (spec 121): #664 remains open after rebase/push/validation on branch codex/spec-121-onboarding-openclaw-agents-r2. The required "git diff main --stat shows only 4 files" criterion cannot currently be satisfied because origin/main does not include onboarding base files (cmd/otter/init.go, cmd/otter/init_test.go, internal/import/openclaw.go, internal/import/openclaw_test.go).

## [2026-02-10 22:25 MST] Spec 124 — Local Setup Postgres Role/Database Bootstrap — APPROVED
- Reviewer: Claude Opus 4.6 (automated reviewer)
- Branch `codex/spec-124-local-setup-role-bootstrap` merged to main
- 1 commit (9cd28ed), 2 files changed (193 insertions, 6 deletions)
- Files: `scripts/setup.sh`, `scripts/setup_test.sh`
- Pre-merge gate: trial merge with main clean, `bash scripts/setup_test.sh` passes (14 tests), go vet/go build failures pre-existing on main (duplicate files unrelated to this spec), frontend test failures (6) pre-existing on main (0 web files changed)
- All 4 acceptance criteria verified:
  1. Setup local-psql path creates missing role/database from DATABASE_URL before migrations
  2. Existing role/database path remains idempotent (IF NOT EXISTS guards)
  3. Tests cover both creation-needed and compose-skip cases
  4. `scripts/setup_test.sh` passes
- Security: SQL construction uses `sql_escape_literal()` for literal quoting + PostgreSQL `format('%I'/'%L')` for identifiers/literals inside PL/pgSQL DO blocks; acceptable for local dev setup threat model
- Scope: cleanly isolated (scripts-only), single commit, single spec, no unrelated changes
- Execution log complete with timestamped entries for all issues, commits, and test runs

- [2026-02-12 03:40 MST] Follow-up needed: queue remains empty in 02-in-progress and 01-ready, but both review PRs (#765, #769) now fail E2E (`E2E Tests` check run IDs 21939279046 and 21939282419). Primary failure signal is Playwright strict-mode locator collision in `web/e2e/agents.spec.ts` for `getByRole('button', { name: /Offline.*1/i })` matching both status filter and agent card role button. Next action when implementation is re-opened: create a micro-issue with explicit tests to scope selectors to status-filter controls, implement via TDD, and re-run CI for both review branches.
- [2026-02-12 03:46 MST] Queue blocker follow-up: no actionable specs in 01-ready/02-in-progress. Review PRs #765 and #769 both fail E2E () due to strict-mode locator collision around Offline status button selection in web/e2e/agents.spec.ts ( resolves to multiple elements). Next actionable implementation when queue is reopened: create a small GitHub issue with explicit tests for status-filter-scoped selectors, implement via TDD on the appropriate spec branch, and re-run CI.
- [2026-02-12 03:46 MST] Queue blocker follow-up correction: no actionable specs in 01-ready/02-in-progress. Review PRs #765 and #769 fail E2E due to strict-mode locator collision in web/e2e/agents.spec.ts where getByRole('button', { name: /Offline.*1/i }) matches multiple elements. Next implementation when queue is reopened: create a small GitHub issue with explicit tests for status-filter-scoped selectors, implement via TDD on the appropriate branch, and re-run CI.
- [2026-02-12 04:03 MST] Queue blocker (current run): Completed Start-of-Run Preflight in required order from `/Users/sam/Documents/Dev/otter-camp/issues/instructions.md`. No actionable spec `.md` files in `/Users/sam/Documents/Dev/otter-camp/issues/02-in-progress` (empty) or `/Users/sam/Documents/Dev/otter-camp/issues/01-ready` (empty; only `.DS_Store`). Prior-stop classification remains `test failure` on review PRs `#765` and `#769` (`E2E Tests` failing due Playwright strict-mode locator collision in `web/e2e/agents.spec.ts` around `getByRole('button', { name: /Offline.*1/i })`). GitHub/local reconciliation is aligned: open implementation issues = none; review PRs remain mapped to specs in `03-needs-review`. Required follow-up: queue at least one actionable spec into `01-ready`/`02-in-progress` or explicitly re-open a review spec with a micro-issue and TDD fix for the E2E selector collision.
- [2026-02-12 04:13 MST] Follow-up context: While fixing strict-mode status-filter selector collisions for PRs #765/#769, targeted Playwright status-filter tests pass on both branches. Local full-file command `cd web && npx playwright test e2e/agents.spec.ts --project=chromium` still shows pre-existing failures in DM modal and API-error tests (`opens DM modal`, `closes DM modal`, `can send message in DM`, `handles API error gracefully`) unrelated to the selector-scoping change.
