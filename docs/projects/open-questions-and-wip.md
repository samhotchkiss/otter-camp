# Projects: Open Questions and WIP

> Summary: Project subsystem gaps, ambiguous decisions, and active cleanup targets.

> Audience: Agents planning project/platform roadmap work.

## Known WIP

- Legacy docs and naming drift (AI Hub/GitClaw remnants) still appear outside this new structure.
- Some feature specs in `use-cases/` are richer than current UI behavior and need explicit parity review.
- Notification API model is inconsistent between frontend context calls and backend routes.

## Decisions Needed

- Canonical hosted URL pattern: `{site}.otter.camp` vs fixed hostnames.
- Whether issue/project review UX should fully enforce spec-driven gate checks before close.
- How aggressively to prune stale duplicate files/folders in repo root and frontend tree.

## Change Log

- 2026-02-16: Created canonical documentation file and migrated relevant legacy content.
