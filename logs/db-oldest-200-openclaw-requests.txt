Go to **1Password.com → Developer Tools → Infrastructure Secrets → Service Accounts**\n2. Create a service account with access to the vaults I need\n3. Copy the token and I'll store it as an environment variable\n\nThen I can use:\n```bash\nexport OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=\"\u003cREDACTED\u003e\"\nop read op://Personal/some-item/password\n```\n\nNo prompts, works headlessly.\n\n**Option 2: Keep desktop app unlocked + Touch ID**\n\nIf you leave 1Password unlocked and have Touch ID enabled, it'll prompt you once per session but not every command. Less automated, but simpler setup.\n\n---\n\n**For full automation, go with a Service Account.** You can scope it to specific vaults (like \"Personal\" or a \"Frank\" vault) so I only access what I need.\n\nWant me to walk you through creating the service account?\n- id=403c3d01-8249-52ba-affd-abe037362db0 created_at=2026-01-26T17:50:47Z conversation_id=96678164-0013-4224-9214-24b57da72e69\n  you can't use the 1p cli?\n[message_id: 89b95a48-538e-4860-b729-e7c2aa278789]\n- id=5e48389d-ccf7-5a7a-9591-ad9e3c36e03d created_at=2026-01-26T17:50:47Z conversation_id=96678164-0013-4224-9214-24b57da72e69\n  I can!

For CLI integration to work automatically:\n\n1. **Open the 1Password app** and unlock it\n2. **Enable CLI integration**: Settings → Developer → \"Integrate with 1Password CLI\"\n\nOnce that's on and the app is unlocked, I should be able to run `op` commands without prompts (it uses the app's auth).\n\nIs the 1Password app running and unlocked right now?

The sign-in probably triggered a prompt in the 1Password app - did you see a Touch ID or approval request pop up?\n\nIf not, try running this yourself in Terminal to see what happens:\n```\nop signin --account hotchkissfam\n```\n\nIt should prompt in the 1Password app for approval. Once you approve it once, I should be able to use it.\n- id=2c5d72bb-d009-565b-b0d0-1927f5abb52a created_at=2026-01-26T17:52:31Z conversation_id=96678164-0013-4224-9214-24b57da72e69\n  I got the touchid approval interface and accepted it\n[message_id: 58eb522f-c436-4d11-b43b-73f506b22d55]\n- id=24528f7e-207d-5092-93aa-ff8bc8b9c41d created_at=2026-01-26T17:52:35Z conversation_id=96678164-0013-4224-9214-24b57da72e69\n  The session might not persist across my exec calls.

For truly persistent headless access, there's one clean solution:\n\n**1Password Service Account**\n\n1. Go to: https://start.1password.com/integrations/infrastructure-secrets\n2. Create a Service Account (e.g., \"Frank\")\n3. Grant it access to the vaults I need (Personal, etc.)\n4. Copy the token\n\nThen I add it to my environment:\n```bash\nexport OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=\"\u003cREDACTED\u003e\"\n```\n\nAfter that, I can run `op` commands with zero prompts, forever. No Touch ID, no desktop app needed.\n\nWant to set one up?

Security design.\n\n**Two options:**\n\n1. **Create a shared vault for me** (e.g., \"Frank\" or \"Automation\")\n   - Move/copy items I need access to into that vault\n   - Grant the service account access to it\n\n2. **Stick with the chained approach** - `op signin \u0026\u0026 op ...` works fine, just slightly slower. The session persists for a while after you Touch ID once, so it's not every single command.\n\nOption 1 is cleaner if there are specific credentials you want me to manage (like TherapyPortal, Fastmail, etc.). You'd just put those in the shared vault.\n\nWorth creating a \"Frank\" vault?\n- id=1e63b98e-dcf5-5795-959f-195a679f45c4 created_at=2026-01-26T17:55:59Z conversation_id=96678164-0013-4224-9214-24b57da72e69\n  I set up the key and made it so you can create a enw vault: ops_\u003cREDACTED\u003e\n[message_id: 9607a966-aeae-4cca-9775-06cbbba2b0ab]\n- id=d8a26981-32fc-5476-9036-0f81791cfe9d created_at=2026-01-26T17:56:11Z conversation_id=96678164-0013-4224-9214-24b57da72e69\n  Works!

For truly persistent headless access, there's one clean solution:\n\n**1Password Service Account**\n\n1. Go to: https://start.1password.com/integrations/infrastructure-secrets\n2. Create a Service Account (e.g., \"Frank\")\n3. Grant it access to the vaults I need (Personal, etc.)\n4. Copy the token\n\nThen I add it to my environment:\n```bash\nexport OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=\"\u003cREDACTED\u003e\"\n```\n\nAfter that, I can run `op` commands with zero prompts, forever.

Security design.\n\n**Two options:**\n\n1. **Create a shared vault for me** (e.g., \"Frank\" or \"Automation\")\n   - Move/copy items I need access to into that vault\n   - Grant the service account access to it\n\n2. **Stick with the chained approach** - `op signin \u0026\u0026 op ...` works fine, just slightly slower. The session persists for a while after you Touch ID once, so it's not every single command.\n\nOption 1 is cleaner if there are specific credentials you want me to manage (like TherapyPortal, Fastmail, etc.). You'd just put those in the shared vault.\n\nWorth creating a \"Frank\" vault?\n- id=1e63b98e-dcf5-5795-959f-195a679f45c4 created_at=2026-01-26T17:55:59Z conversation_id=96678164-0013-4224-9214-24b57da72e69\n  I set up the key and made it so you can create a enw vault: ops_\u003cREDACTED\u003e\n[message_id: 9607a966-aeae-4cca-9775-06cbbba2b0ab]\n- id=d8a26981-32fc-5476-9036-0f81791cfe9d created_at=2026-01-26T17:56:11Z conversation_id=96678164-0013-4224-9214-24b57da72e69\n  Works!

You'll need to grant yourself access in the admin settings:\n\n1. Go to **https://hotchkissfam.1password.com** (web interface)\n2. Click **Vaults** in the sidebar\n3. Find **Frank** vault\n4. Add yourself (s@swh.me) to it\n\nOr if that doesn't show it, check **Settings → Service Accounts → Frank's service account → Vault Access** — you might need to manage permissions there.\n\nThe vault is definitely created, just needs to be shared with your user account.\n- id=3aa5abdf-05be-525a-a774-a5237f39faef created_at=2026-01-26T17:57:58Z conversation_id=a36237ba-a9fa-468c-bce7-24c1a5def658\n  and I've quit and reopened\n[message_id: 0181ce65-547c-4eb6-ae5b-fab37abcea46]\n- id=98369460-177c-592b-86b5-99067b345038 created_at=2026-01-26T17:58:16Z conversation_id=a36237ba-a9fa-468c-bce7-24c1a5def658\n  Just granted you access.

Maybe sync delay? Let me check again:\n- id=411b84c3-980c-5ba1-91a2-0e7f0ca034e2 created_at=2026-01-26T17:59:18Z conversation_id=a36237ba-a9fa-468c-bce7-24c1a5def658\n  Still only seeing the one item. Are you seeing more in the Frank vault on your end? Might need a moment to sync, or try forcing a sync in the 1Password app (Cmd+R or click the sync icon).\n",
