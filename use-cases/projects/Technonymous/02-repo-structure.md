# Technonymous — Repo Structure

## Objective
Define a simple, consistent repo layout for writing + drafts + notes.

## Proposed Structure
```
/notes/            # scratch ideas, brainstorms, snippets
/posts/            # finished or in‑progress posts
/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
/assets/           # images committed to repo (non‑embedded)
/README.md
```

## Rules
- Scratch ideas go in `/notes/`.
- Posts are organized by date in `/posts/`.
- Commit on each meaningful change (notes or posts).
