# Technonymous — Issue as PR

## Objective
Each post is treated like a PR: reviewable, commentable, and mergeable.

## Workflow
1. **Draft post** in repo (`/posts/`).
2. Create **issue** for the post.
3. Post evolves through commits (commit body = work description).
4. Sam reviews and leaves inline feedback.
5. When approved, mark issue **Completed**.

## Rules
- We are **not** creating GitHub PRs in MVP.
- The issue is the review container in OtterCamp.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Post has an associated issue.
- Inline comments are anchored to the document.
- Approval state is visible in the issue.
