# Technonymous — Commit Cadence

## Objective
Reinforce “commit‑first” behavior for writing workflows.

## Rules
- Commit after **every meaningful change** (outline, section, paragraph group, edits).
- Commit messages must include a **verbose body** describing changes.
- Commits are the canonical activity stream.

## Example
```
write: expand intro + add thesis paragraph

Expanded the opening paragraph to include the core thesis and clarified the
stakes in the second paragraph. Added two supporting bullets in section two.
```
