# Technonymous — Media & Metadata

## Media (Images)
- Images are **committed to the repo** (not embedded externally).
- Display images in the editor with a preview.
- **MVP:** image preview only (no inline image comments).
- Image comments are a **post‑MVP enhancement** and should be tracked separately.

## Metadata
- No formal metadata system in MVP.
- If needed, agent can include a **doc block at top** of the Markdown file.
